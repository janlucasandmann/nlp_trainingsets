Aphasia, impairment of language after stroke or other neurological insult, is a common and of- ten devastating condition that affects nearly every social activity and interaction. Behavioral speech and language therapy is the mainstay of treatment, although other interventions have been introduced to augment the effects of the behavioral therapy. In this narrative review, we discuss advances in aphasia therapy in the last 5 years and focus primarily on properly powered, randomized, controlled trials of both behavioral therapies and interventions to augment therapy for post-stroke aphasia. These trials include evaluation of behavioral therapies and computer-de- livered language therapies. We also discuss outcome prediction trials as well as interventional trials that have employed noninvasive brain stimulation, or medications to augment language therapy. Supported by evidence from Phase III trials and large meta-analyses, it is now generally accepted that aphasia therapy can improve language processing for many patients. Not all pa- tients respond similarly to aphasia therapy with the most severe patients being the least likely responders. Nevertheless, it is imperative that all patients, regardless of severity, receive aphasia management focused on direct therapy of language deficits, counseling, or both. Emerging evi- dence from Phase II trials suggests transcranial brain stimulation is a promising method to boost aphasia therapy outcomes.

Introduction
Aphasia is a language disorder that can have profound nega- tive effects on quality of life. It is most often due to left hemi- sphere stroke but can also be caused by other types of dam- age—such as trauma or neurodegenerative disease—that affect the language network of the brain. Here, we review therapy for post-stroke aphasia, focusing on recent clinical trials. Although most neurologists have the greatest familiarity with pharma- ceutical interventions, we begin by discussing behavioral ther- apies, because other interventions augment behavioral inter-
ventions. That is, medications and noninvasive brain stimula- tion have been used in conjunction with, rather than in place of, behavioral therapies.
Several recent publications have reviewed the mechanisms of aphasia recovery, and in some cases the mechanisms of therapy1-4 revealed by changes in task-related brain activa- tions or changes in functional connectivity within functional networks.1-6 Therefore, we will emphasize the empirical effects of therapy with less focus on the neural mechanisms that pro- mote treated recovery from aphasia.

 Behavioral interventions
Behavioral therapy to improve language in stroke aphasia: the basics
By far, the most common approach to aphasia rehabilitation is behavioral speech and language therapy (SLT). SLT was even de- scribed by Paul Broca in his seminal 1865 paper,7 and it remains the standard of care for patients with aphasia.8
There are many different approaches to SLT, with two main camps: (1) Impairment-based approaches focus directly on decreasing the language impairment through structured ther- apy that targets the sub-components of language such as phonology, lexical-semantics, or syntax.9-11 The goal is to im- prove language functions with the assumptions that doing so will generalize to communication abilities and, by extension, communicative quality of life. (2) Functional communication approaches more directly target communication abilities and do not necessarily focus on generalization to reduce speech or lan- guage deficits. Rather, these latter approaches are more likely to focus on stimuli with direct personal relevance. Additionally, functional therapy emphasizes eliminating communication bar- riers in the environment, caregiver training to enhance commu- nication, and improving the success of communication rather than reducing impairment (see Martin et al.12 for review and examples of the two approaches).
Efficacy of behavioral speech and language therapy for aphasia
The literature on aphasia therapy is marred by mostly sin- gle-case design and small group studies (e.g., references13-15). Perhaps because of this historical focus on underpowered stud- ies, the efficacy of aphasia therapy was debated for decades and, until relatively recently, remained highly controversial.16-18 Furthermore, by focusing solely on speech and language mea- sures as markers of outcome, most studies failed to demon- strate meaningful improvements. In acute patients, it has been relatively difficult to demonstrate that early aphasia recovery is spurred by SLT rather than inherent recovery processes.19 In ad- dition, no standards have been developed for what works best for patients with different aphasic impairment patterns. How- ever, in the past decade, a much clearer picture of the overall efficacy of SLT for aphasia has emerged. Meta-analyses of a large number of smaller studies generally support the notion that SLT is very much worthwhile for aphasic patients.16,17,20,21 Moreover, the results of a recent Phase III randomized con- trolled trial (RCT) by Breitenstein et al.18 unequivocally support the use of impairment-based SLT to improve speech production in chronic aphasia. Specifically, this trial revealed that SLT does
improve effectiveness of verbal communication measured using the Amsterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test A (ANELT-A;22 A-scale [Cohen’s d=0.58; medium effect size]). Moreover, the trial also revealed an improvement in communi- cative quality of life (Cohen’s d=0.27), an important finding that had eluded many earlier trials (e.g., references23-25). Taken to- gether, large meta-analyses and the Breitenstein et al.18 trial provide robust evidence in favor of SLT for post-stroke aphasia.
Optimal timing of intervention: chronic vs. acute phase of post-stroke
In spite of progress in the field, the optimal timing of interven- tion after stroke remains unclear. Equally important, it is not known if or when patients reach a recovery plateau. Whereas animal models of stroke suggest early intervention is probably important26 we have no definitive data in aphasia.27 Although most aphasia therapy studies have enrolled chronic patients, it seems likely that earlier aphasia therapy is also effective.28 However, two large RCTs published in the last 5 years do not support this notion. In the Rotterdam Aphasia Therapy Study-3 (RATS-3),29 152 patients with acute aphasia due to stroke were randomized to receive either 4 weeks of impairment-based SLT (1 hour/day) or no therapy. Relying on the same outcome mea- sure as Breitenstein et al.,18 ANELT-A,29 no group differences were revealed at the primary endpoint (P=0.805), measured at 4 weeks after randomization, or at secondary endpoints at 3 (P=0.767) and 6 (P=0.807) months after randomization. A more recent RCT by Godecke et al.30 titled Very Early Rehabilitation for SpEech (VERSE) also yielded a non-significant result for the primary analysis. Among 246 patients with acute aphasia, there were no differences in changes in overall aphasia severity be- tween the three study arms (P=0.59): usual care, usual care+20 SLT sessions, and usual care+20 sessions of specialized impair- ment-based therapy program designed by an “aphasia Expert Advisory Committee.” The mean number of therapy hours in the ‘usual care’ group was 9.5 (standard deviation [SD] 7.6) over 28 days whereas the other two groups averaged 22.7 hours of therapy (SD 8.4) over 32 days. Although VERSE did not include a ‘no therapy’ control arm, it suggests that increasing the intensi- ty of SLT from a mean of 0.34 to 0.71 hours/day in the early phases of recovery may not further improve recovery from aphasia. If there is a dose-response relationship between the amount of therapy and early recovery from aphasia, one would expect that the more intensive groups would have experienced better outcome. In this context, it is worth noting that early aphasia recovery is highly variable and is probably influenced by several different factors that may be difficult to control in reha- bilitation studies. Equally important, it is clear that not all SLT

approaches are equally potent and that future trials employing different kinds of SLT may reveal positive outcomes. Moreover, future research may identify the minimum dose needed to af- fect language improvement in acute to subacute stroke. Just like there is considerable variability in response to SLT,31 it seems reasonable to suggest that some patients may need more ther- apy to experience an improvement in communication abilities.
In contrast to early aphasia therapy, there is ample evidence, including Breitenstein et al.,18 that more SLT in the chronic phase is associated with greater long-term recovery. A recent study revealed that among chronic stroke patients, improve- ment in language processing over several years in language processing among chronic stroke patients with aphasia is associated with more SLT sessions.32 This study emphasized that approximately half of chronic stroke patients continue to experience recovery from aphasia even many years after stroke. The remaining half either are relatively stable or actually expe- rience decline, an often overlooked fact that may represent an under-appreciated therapeutic target. Two earlier studies very much echo the finding that approximately half of chronic pa- tients continue to experience recovery.33,34 Reasons for decline in language by other patients remain unclear, but white matter hyperintensities seen on T2-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or fluid attenuated inversion recovery may be one culprit. One study revealed that patients who experienced long-term lan- guage decline were more likely to show greater extent of white matter hyperintensities in comparison to patients who stabi- lized or improved.35 A related study showed that these white matter hyperintensities are disproportionally associated with loss of long-range white matter fibers, which could provide a more specific mechanistic account of worsening aphasic symp- toms in chronic patients.36 Although some studies indicate that on average, stroke patients show steady cognitive decline after stroke,37 a careful review of the literature indicates that the average slow decline instead reflects a sharp decline by about 25% of patients, but slow improvement or stability in others. The finding that approximately a quarter of individuals with post-stroke aphasia are at risk for significant decline in function emphasizes the need for more aggressive monitoring of, and therapy for, vascular risk factors among these patients.
Predicting the outcome of behavioral therapy of aphasia
Although demonstration for the efficacy of SLT for aphasia is improving, predicting which patients are likely to respond and what therapy works best for individual patients remains a major challenge. In 1972, Darley38 suggested that factors such as age, education, intelligence, social status, health, time post-stroke,
and aphasia type are related to success in aphasia therapy, but that very few studies had actually incorporated these factors as predictors of outcome. Unfortunately, more than four decades later, the situation is not drastically improved, as research has failed to establish a strong relationship between specific patient factors and treated aphasia recovery. A few studies have related patient characteristics to spontaneous recovery;14,39-41 however, it is not known whether the same factors would predict aphasia therapy outcome. Accordingly, clinicians who routinely treat patients with aphasia have somewhat limited empirical data to guide their therapy and predict outcome. Whereas biomarker studies are common in medicine, somewhat limited research has focused on understanding the relationship between patient factors and aphasia rehabilitation potential in stroke (e.g., refer- ences40,42,43). Some recent studies suggest imaging markers, such as larger lesion volume44,45 and greater severity of leukoaraio- sis,35 are associated with worse long-term outcome. Other fac- tors have also been implicated such as the degree of damage to posterior superior temporal gyrus or arcuate fasciculus,46,47 inde- pendently of lesion volume, and recovery in patients with dam- age to these critical areas may be influenced by medications.46
Aphasia severity, a factor related to overall lesion volume, is one of the very few variables that has been identified as a reliable predictor of SLT outcome, and it is generally accepted that more severe patients are less likely to respond to SLT.41,48 The aforementioned trials by Breitenstein et al.,18 Nouwens et al.,29 and Godecke et al.30 each revealed that aphasia severity was a strong predictor of overall outcome with more severe patients benefitting less from SLT. It is a caveat; however, that aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct where different patients with severe aphasia might present with very different language impairment profiles. Nevertheless, all else being equal, patients with more severe language impairment are probably less likely to experience spontaneous or therapy-induced re- covery. Importantly, speech-language pathologists seem to be very much aware of the connection between aphasia severity and treatment outcome. In a survey of 54 speech-language pathologists, severity and nature of post-stroke aphasia were identified among the most important factors for forming an aphasia prognosis.49 We will return to this aphasia severity and treatment outcome in more detail below.
In a trial that recently completed enrollment (n=128) titled Predicting Outcomes of LAnguage Rehabilitation in aphasia (POLAR)50 some initial results are emerging, identifying factors that influence SLT-related improvements in naming and dis- course production at 1-week, 1-month, and 6-months following SLT completion. POLAR involves a cross-over design where half of the participants with chronic aphasia are randomized to first

Figure 1. The relationship between improvement in naming (y-axis) and aphasia severity (x-axis). Improvement in correct naming was measured using the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) whereas aphasia severity was qualified as the overall severity score, aphasia quotient on the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised Aphasia Quotient (WAB-R AQ). (A) The graph shows raw change in correct naming whereas (B) the graph shows change in naming as proportion of potential room for improvement. Note the discrepancy in the graphs at the higher end of the WAB AQ spectrum, which is caused by the mildest cases having relatively limited room for improvement at baseline compared to their counterparts with more severe forms of aphasia.
undergo 3 weeks of SLT (5 times/week) focused on phonological processing and then receive 3 weeks of semantically focused SLT with a 4-week break between the two SLT phases. The re- maining half of participants are randomized to receive semantic SLT first and then phonological SLT during the second therapy phase. Preliminary analyses incorporating data from the first 74 trial completers revealed statistically significant improvements in correct naming on the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT)51 when comparing results between baseline and 1-week after comple- tion of the second therapy phase (t(74)=6.1765, P<0.00001). This effect was maintained at 6 months after therapy com- pletion (t(74)=5.6, P<0.0001). In addition, significant improve- ments were revealed in discourse production immediately after completion of the second therapy phase (t(74)=2.37, P=0.02), and again at 6 months post-therapy (t(74)=3.23, P=0.002). Dis- course production was qualified and measured as total words produced per minute during three separate discourse tasks.
In accordance with the primary purpose of POLAR, linear mixed effects modeling was applied to understand what base- line factors predict therapy outcome at 6 months post-treat- ment. For change in correct naming, two predictors emerged: Overall aphasia severity (P<0.03) and participant age (P=0.006). Overall, older individuals and those with more severe aphasia were less likely to show treatment related improvements in the POLAR trial. A significant relationship between a measure on a cognitive test that is thought to minimally tax with involve language processing, the WAIS matrix test and treatment out- come in POLAR was not revealed, which is inconsistent with what others have found. For example, Dignam et al.52 revealed that cognitive factors such as verbal working memory predict
SLT-related improvements in naming. Similarly, a study by Gilmore et al.53 suggested that cognitive factors predict the outcome of SLT targeting either sentence comprehension or naming in aphasia. Much like Breitenstein et al.,18 Nouwens et al.,29 and Godecke et al.,30 these preliminary data from POLAR suggest participants with more severe aphasia are less likely to respond to SLT. This point is illustrated in Figure 1, which in- cludes data from the POLAR trial showing the relation between WAB-R aphasia quotient (WAB-R AQ), and improvements in correct naming on the PNT from baseline to 1-week post-ther- apy. The WAB-R AQ is a measure of overall severity, and the therapy outcome here was calculated two different ways (1) raw change in correct naming and (2) change in correct nam- ing divided by the room for improvement at baseline. These data suggest that although milder aphasia does not guarantee positive therapy-related improvement in naming, the most severe patients are considerably less likely to respond. As a side note, overall lesion size was not associated with outcome at 6 months post-therapy in POLAR.
Another POLAR report showed that the type of SLT matters for different individuals with aphasia. Again, POLAR involves a cross-over design aimed at comparing the effects of phonolog- ically focused SLT to semantically focused SLT on speech pro- duction in aphasia.54 Regardless of therapy order, the average improvement in naming following the semantically focused SLT was far superior to the outcome of the phonologically fo- cused SLT (P=0.008). In spite of the clear overall advantage of the semantically focused SLT, it is worth noting that different patterns of therapy response emerged across the two therapy types. Some participants responded to both approaches, some

responded to only one and several more showed no response, regardless of SLT type. Crucially, there was an interaction be- tween aphasia severity and therapy type response, where more severe individuals with less fluent speech responded more to phonological therapy (P=0.049), whereas milder cases showed significantly better response to semantic therapy (P=0.018). This relationship is clearly demonstrated in Figure 2, which shows the correlation matrix between naming improvements following the semantic or phonological therapies in relation to various measures of language abilities. Specifically, positive response (improvement in naming) to the phonologically focused SLT was negatively correlated with various language scores, including measures of grammatical and phonological processing as well as measures of overall aphasia severity and naming impairment. In contrast, response to the semantically focused SLT was pos- itively correlated with the same measures of language abilities. With regard to aphasia type, individuals with either anomic or conduction aphasia showed preferentially better response to the semantic than the phonologically focused treatment. How- ever, no aphasia type was associated with significantly better response to the phonologically focused treatment over the se- mantic treatment.
To explore whether lesion location predicted outcome in POLAR, lesion-load in language related cortical regions55 was used to predict improvement on the PNT (n=77) in univariate analyses. For overall change in correct naming on the PNT from baseline to 1-week after completion of the second treatment phase, greater proportional damage to the left middle occipital gyrus (ß=–0.294, P=0.010) and the posterior middle tempo- ral gyrus (ß=–0.216, P=0.060) predicted poorer response to treatment (Figure 3). Response to phonological treatment was

independently predicted by damage to four regions of interest: the middle frontal gyrus (ß=0.232, P=0.042), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis (ß=0.255, P=0.025), precentral gyrus (ß=0.260, P=0.022), and supramarginal gyrus (ß=0.199, P=0.083). Interestingly, aphasia severity did not emerge as a significant predictor when damage to these four regions was accounted for. No single lesion location predicted response to semantically focused treatment. This preliminary report from POLAR suggests that lesion location is actually associated not only with overall SLT response but also with SLT type. It is too early to say whether these results can be used to guide clinical treatment of aphasia but, at the very least, they provide insights into what kinds of lesion patterns are associated with poor treatment outcome.

 There are certainly many other ways that SLT can be varied other than contrasting semantic versus phonological training. For example, Conroy et al.56 compared SLT that emphasized quicker naming to a more conventional approach where speed- ed naming was not emphasized. In short, this study revealed that greater focus on faster speed and greater accuracy during training was more effective for improving naming accuracy and speed of naming for trained items as well as for generalization to connected speech. Along with Basilakos et al.,35 the findings by Kristinsson et al.54 emphasize the importance of personalized predictors of therapy outcome where baseline factors can be used to stratify SLT type.
In a retrospective analysis, our group (unpublished) examined data from three separate trials to understand the relationship between overall aphasia severity, age, and aphasia therapy success. Although the three studies involved different kinds of aphasia therapy and different sample sizes (total n=179), the outcome measures for each trial were similar and focused on changes in correct naming abilities. Across all three studies, overall aphasia severity, measured as the WAB-R AQ, was a strong predictor of therapy outcome. Specifically, individuals with more severe aphasia were less likely to respond to SLT. In two out of the three studies, age was also related to outcome, such that older participants were less likely to respond to ther- apy. Given that greater aphasia severity is, in general, related to larger lesion size, it seems possible that lack of improvement among more severe patients is related to less residual cortex that can take over the function that was lost. Consistent with previous research by Bonilha et al.,57 greater sparing of the residual language network is related to better SLT response. The relation between younger age and better SLT response is certainly not surprising given that any kind of speech and lan- guage restoration associated with SLT must be related to either functional or structural plasticity, or both. As has been shown in numerous studies, the extent of brain plasticity decreases steadily with age,58-60 which may explain why older patients are somewhat less likely to respond to SLT. However, it is imperative to note that although age was related to outcome, it was a relatively weak predictor compared to overall aphasia severity. Indeed, many participants older than 65 in the aforementioned studies did respond to therapy even though their younger coun- terparts, as a group, tended to benefit even more.
Optimal dosage for aphasia therapy is an area of emerging focus in the field of aphasiology. A comprehensive review of this issue found insufficient evidence to recommend an optimal dosage that would result in maximum treatment outcome.61 Although it seems highly plausible that more aphasia therapy is better in almost any case of aphasia, treatment dose as a pre-
dictor of outcome remains under-studied. For a comprehensive review of this issue, readers are referred to Harvey et al.61
Individual therapy vs. group therapy
The most common mode of SLT is one-on-one delivery where a single clinician, typically a speech-language pathologist, treats a single patient. Another mode of SLT delivery is group therapy, a tradition that was started as early as post World War II in Vet- erans Administration hospitals in the United States. Very limited data are available on the effectiveness of group SLT for aphasia, and third party reimbursers tend not to support it.62 Regardless of the mode, most persons with chronic aphasia do not receive an adequate amount of aphasia therapy to maximize recovery. Two sources of evidence are particularly important in this con- text: First, as discussed above, considerable evidence supports the utility of SLT for aphasia.16-18 Second, some studies show that more therapy is better, regardless of intensity (the amount per time unit).63,64 Unfortunately, recent data on the typical number of aphasia therapy sessions are lacking. One survey published 20 years ago indicated that patients with aphasia in the United States could expect to receive approximately 15 ses- sions of therapy.65 It is unlikely that the average number of therapy sessions has increased in the current healthcare cli- mate. Thankfully, the number of aphasia centers that provide more intensive therapy and aphasia groups is on the rise (e.g., references66-68). Yet, the number of individuals served by these centers represents a very small fraction of the two million who have chronic aphasia in North America.69 There are several rea- sons why individuals with chronic aphasia are underserved. Lack of third party reimbursement is undoubtedly a major barrier;69 however, other factors such as difficulty with transportation to and from therapy and limited availability of speech-language pathologists, especially in rural areas, may also play a role.
In-person vs. telerehabilitation
One way to improve access to aphasia therapy is by means of telerehabilitation (telerehab). Providing SLT via remote therapy could vastly increase the availability of speech-language pa- thologists and possibly decrease costs. A few studies have start- ed to explore the effectiveness of telerehab for aphasia, both clinician-supervised therapy and unsupervised therapy (com- puterized therapy). One recently completed pilot trial indicated that supplementing ‘standard of care’ SLT for aphasia with tel- erehab did not improve the primary outcome (naming) com- pared to ‘standard of care’ SLT by itself.70 It is worth noting; however, that this trial was not aimed at establishing whether telerehab by itself is non-inferior to traditional in-person SLT. A separate trial compared the effects of telerehab and in-person

SLT in individuals with chronic aphasia and found no difference between the two modes of therapy.71 Unfortunately, this study included only five participants in each condition and, therefore, was almost surely underpowered. A larger study72 (n=44) com- pared in-person SLT to a hybrid version of telerehab SLT: one session per week of clinician administered therapy via telerehab, supplemented with computerized therapy (Lingraphica)73 at least four times a week. This trial found hybrid telerehab to be non-inferior to in-person SLT for chronic aphasia. In a separate study, Telerehabilitation Group Aphasia Intervention and Net- working (TeleGAIN),74 19 participants with chronic aphasia un- derwent group treatment for 12 weeks that was delivered via telerehab. Here, treatment focused on conversational engage- ment among participants with aphasia as well as functional treatment approaches. Although this study assessed a large number of endpoints, its most notable result was that partici- pants communicative quality of life was improved after treat- ment compared to baseline. This is a very promising finding, which can be further tested in a larger trial that includes a con- trol group and where the statistical analyses control for multi- ple comparisons when calculating changes across outcome measures.
Larger studies are needed to show that telerehab is non-in- ferior to in-person SLT, which will allow expanded availability of aphasia rehabilitation. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many clinicians to transition to telerehab in place of face-to-face delivery, and third party payors have begun to cover the charges, which suggests a po- tential for this type of service delivery model to expand access to SLT for aphasia.
Computerized therapy
A fast-emerging approach to aphasia management is computer- ized SLT. One group study (n=21) that employed a pre- and post-comparison of naming abilities showed a positive outcome of a 6-month SLT regimen.75 Much like many other trials, this study also showed a relationship between aphasia severity and long-term outcome with more severe patients maintaining less improvement at 4 months post-therapy. The authors concluded that independent home practice using computerized therapy could represent a viable alternative to clinician-based therapy, which often is not available to chronic patients. A large RCT (n=278) with three arms further supports the potential utility of computerized aphasia therapy (Big CACTUS).76 Here, patients at least 4 months post-stroke were randomized to receive usual care; usual care supplemented with self-administered computer- ized SLT; or usual care with added attention therapy. The group that received the added computerized SLT experienced greater
improvement in naming (P<0.0001), but not in functional com- munication (P>0.05), compared to the other two groups. Al- though improvement in ‘real life’ functional communication is the desired outcome of aphasia therapy, such improvements are notoriously difficult to measure. Nevertheless, the results provide convincing evidence that computerized SLT may further enhance naming ability in aphasia. Subsequently, Latimer et al.77 analyzed the Big CACTUS data to understand whether adding self-admin- istered computerized SLT to usual care was cost-effective. Un- fortunately, because Big CACTUS did not yield a statistically sig- nificant improvement in quality of life associated with the addi- tion of computerized SLT to usual care, the cost-effectiveness analysis was inconclusive. Nevertheless, this study emphasizes the need for other trials to follow suit and build in cost-effec- tiveness analyses so that stakeholders can understand not only whether a given treatment is effective in improving communica- tion abilities but also whether it is cost-effective.
A more recently completed trial by Fleming et al.78 relied on a cross-over design to study the effects of computerized therapy to improve auditory comprehension in aphasia. Using an in-house developed app (Listen-In) that targets auditory comprehension at the single word, phrase, and sentence level and is run on a computer tablet, participants (n=35) were ran- domized to first receive 12 weeks of self-administered Listen-In training and then 12 weeks of usual care, or vice versa. One of the several strengths of this trial was that participants received a relatively high dose of therapy with an average of 85 hours of training using Listen-In. A study-specific outcome test of auditory comprehension revealed greater comprehension im- provement for trained items associated with Listen-In in com- parison to usual care (t(34)=4.09, P<0.001, Cohen’s d=1.32). A similar comparison for untrained items revealed non-signifi- cant results. Changes in auditory comprehension measured on two sub-tests of the Comprehensive Aphasia Test79 were also not significant between Listen-In and usual care. Although not the purpose of the current review, it is notable that Fleming et al.78 also revealed structural brain changes (assessed using T1- MRI) in both white (left hemisphere) and gray matter (right hemisphere) superior temporal gyrus that correlated with ther- apy outcome in a sub-set of the participants (n=25). Although these effects need to be verified in a larger sample, this study provides convincing evidence that aphasia therapy changes the structure of the brain. Most importantly for clinical purposes, the study by Fleming et al.78 demonstrates that computerized therapy can improve auditory comprehension in aphasia. Other smaller studies also further support the utility of computerized SLT. For example, a study of seven chronic stroke patients with aphasia showed that computerized SLT yielded better language

 outcomes than a ‘mind-game’ intervention that did not focus on speech or language training.80
Theory-based therapy
There is a wide range in SLT approaches with regard to which mechanism they tackle or what aspects of language they are expected to improve. For example, most of the studies reviewed so far focus on speech production without necessarily empha- sizing which aspect of processing is targeted by therapy. In con- trast, Treatment of Underlying Forms (TUF) specifically empha- sizes meta-linguistic training to improve grammatical process- ing, both for speech production and comprehension, in patients with Broca’s aphasia.81 In short, TUF initially focuses on training lexical properties of verbs and mapping verb arguments. Then, training moves to complex sentence structures with emphasis on integration and reanalysis of semantic roles. One of the keys to TUF is that it trains more complex sentence structures, which has been shown to generalize to simpler structures.82 Although TUF is not a new therapy approach, a recent study with random- ized assignment to either TUF (n=14) or a control group that re- ceived no therapy (n=5) provides evidence that TUF improves sentence processing among aphasic patients with agramma- tism.83 Relying on the principles of TUF, training focused on complex sentence structures (long passive sentences with ad- junct clauses), which resulted in improvements among the ex- perimental group in both comprehension and production of trained sentences structures, as well as related sentences struc- tures, at both immediate follow-up and at 3 months following therapy completion. No changes in performance were noted in the control group immediately after therapy completion, and no changes in the processing of unrelated sentence structures were noted in the experimental group. Along with several smaller studies,81,84 this study by Barbieri at al.83 suggests TUF as a pre- ferred approach to treat patients with agrammatic aphasia.
In the past two decades, considerable research has focused on the effects of constraint-induced language therapy (CIAT) for aphasia.85 This behavioral therapy approach was based on evidence from motor rehabilitation indicating that constraining the spared limb and forcing patients to use the affected limb in therapy resulted in significant motor improvement. Apply- ing this approach to SLT for aphasia, patients are discouraged from using modalities other than speech, such as gestures or writing, to communicate. This approach has shown promise in several trials,86,87 although it is not superior to more conven- tional SLT provided at similar intensity levels.88,89 It is possible that the success of CIAT so far is primarily related to relatively greater intensity of therapy in those studies rather than the actual constraining of non-verbal expression. An ongoing RCT
(Constraint-Induced or Multi-Modal Personalized Aphasia Re- habilitation [COMPARE]) by Rose et al.90 may shed light on this issue by comparing the effectiveness of CIAT to multi-modality focused SLT as well as standard of care SLT. Unlike CIAT, the multi-modal SLT and the standard of care approaches do not incorporate the constraining aspects of CIAT, but therapy time is controlled across the three study arms. At the time this is writ- ten, enrollment in COMPARE is complete, but the results have not yet been published.
Social approach to therapy
We end this section by discussing what we consider a very posi- tive development to managing aphasia: Life Participation Ap- proaches to Aphasia (LPAA). Although LPAA is not a new con- cept, it has risen in popularity with annual conferences and workshops. Unlike impairment-based or functional therapy ap- proaches to aphasia therapy that focus primarily on reestablish- ing communication abilities, LPAA emphasizes reintegration of persons with aphasia into the community by focusing on resid- ual personal strengths instead of communication disabilities. LPAA could be regarded as an umbrella term for different tactics and approaches that maximize life participation. For example, training where individualized communication strategies are identified and practiced by the person with aphasia and com- munication partners can be effective.91-93 Along the same lines, testing for what individuals can, rather than cannot, communi- cate may help identify residual language abilities and potential communication strengths that otherwise might go unnoticed.94 Another important development in the LPAA realm is the in- creasing number of aphasia groups and aphasia centers.67,95,96 Participation in aphasia groups and centers not only provides psycho-social benefits but may also improve communication and language.97 Despite the lack of large trials of the utility of LPAA, efforts focused on reintegration of persons with aphasia into society should be considered in very positive light. This brings us back to the issue of severity and the fact that persons with the most severe aphasia are unlikely to respond to SLT. We suggest that patients with the most severe aphasia, and, as a result, the least likely individuals to respond to SLT, may be best served by focusing more on LPAA, including counseling, and im- proving communication via approaches such as conversational coaching,98 training alternative communication modalities,99 or even alternative or augmentative communication devices.100,101 This notion is developed in more detail below.
Several large RCTs of SLT in aphasia provide evidence that patients with more severe aphasia are less likely to respond to therapy.18,29,30 This effect is very salient and is demonstrated in Figure 1 where participants with the most severe aphasia

in the POLAR trial experienced very minimal improvement in speech production following 30 sessions of SLT. We suspect that the patients most likely to be referred for SLT are the most severe patients. Unfortunately, these individuals are the least likely to respond to SLT compared to their counterparts with moderate or mild aphasia. Based on this evidence, it would be tempting to discourage referrals of the most severe patients for SLT and, instead, focus rehabilitation on the less severe cases who are more likely to be responders. We think this would be a mistake as we believe all persons with aphasia would benefit from speech therapy services, but that these services need to be personalized based on the individuals’ impairment profile, communicative needs, and recovery potential. In Figure 4, we suggest a simple rubric for how severity of aphasia might be used to determine how rehabilitation efforts could be best tailored to the needs of individuals patients. For the purpose of illustration, we have arranged aphasia severity levels from left-to-right starting with the mildest cases of aphasia, which usually involve relatively smaller cortical lesions, and progress- ing to the most severe cases on the right, which tend to have the most extensive cortical lesions. The graphs represent hy- pothetical language impairment scores for speech production, comprehension, reading, and writing. The bottom of the figure represents a proportional continuum between impairment or functional based therapy versus LPAA or counseling. The patients with the most severe aphasia, including those with global aphasia, would focus mostly on LPAA with relatively
little effort on SLT. Those with less severe aphasia, primarily in the middle of the range between very severe and mild aphasia, would focus relatively less on LPAA but more on direct SLT us- ing either impairment-based or functional SLT approaches. The patients with the least severe aphasia would focus almost all of their effort on direct SLT. Crucially, the type of rehabilitation and level of counseling would need to be further personalized within different levels of overall severity to maximize benefit. This last point cannot be overstated as overall severity levels can mask substantially different patterns of language impair- ment, personal needs, and goals among patients who score in the same severity range on aphasia tests.
Pharmaceutical interventions
Acute interventions
In acute ischemic stroke, the primary mechanism of recovery is restoration of blood flow to the penumbral tissue surrounding the core infarct. Numerous large RCTs have shown overall ben- efit in outcome with intravenous thrombolysis102 or endovascu- lar therapy.103,104 While none of these trials have specifically evaluated the effects on language, case series studies have shown that such interventions do result in improvement of lan- guage functions.105 One small RCT also showed that temporary elevation of blood flow to improve perfusion early after left hemisphere stroke due to large vessel occlusion or stenosis was associated with language improvement.106

 Pharmaceutical interventions to designed to augment behavioral language therapy for aphasia No study has provided evidence that pharmaceutical interven- tion results in significant improvement in language in chronic post-stroke aphasia in the absence of SLT.107 However, several trials have provided preliminary or inconsistent evidence that some medications may augment the effects of SLT, as reported below. A plausible mechanism is that language recovery de- pends on neuroplasticity—neural networks must be modified either by changing connectivity between undamaged nodes of the residual language network or by incorporating new nodes or other networks to assume the functions of the damaged ones.108,109 There is evidence from both humans and animals that behavioral interventions such as mass practice can bring about this type of reorganization through long-term potentia- tion and long-term depression. This type of neural plasticity is facilitated by the presence of neurotransmitters such as nor- epinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and dopamine.110,111 Therefore, medications that alter the availability of these neu- rotransmitters could enhance neuroplasticity.112 While most of the trials of medications to enhance recovery have focused on motor recovery, several RCTs have evaluated the effects on lan- guage recovery.
Early RCTs evaluated the effects of sympathomimetics, which elevate brain catecholamines. A few small nonrandomized trials (see Llano and Small113) and one larger RCT114 demonstrated small but statistically significant effects of dextroamphetamine in augmenting language therapy to improve language test scores. However, results were not adjusted for differences in language therapy duration and have not been subsequently replicated. Levadopa and bromocriptine have shown no consistent benefit over placebo in small RCTs.115-117 Likewise, small RCTs of cholin- esterase inhibitors have shown only scant and/or short-lasting beneficial effects on language compared to placebo.118,119 Me- mantine, a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspar- tate (NMDA) receptor, with effects on serotonin and dopamine receptors and potential reduced excitotoxicity,120 has shown similar minor and short-lived positive effects in one open-label study, which has not been replicated in RCTs.13 Finally, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have been shown in RCTs to have a positive effect on post-stroke motor recovery measured with the Fugl Meyer scale121 and greater improve- ments on a cognitive battery,122 but no effect on the less sensi- tive modified Rankin Scale,123,124 have not been studied in RCTs for aphasia recovery. In summary, there is no consistent evidence that any medication has a substantial effect on aphasia recovery, despite numerous small RCTs to evaluate potential benefit con- ducted over the past five decades.
Noninvasive brain stimulation
Another approach to augmenting synaptic plasticity and reor- ganization of the networks that support language is through noninvasive brain stimulation. The two modalities that have been evaluated in RCT are transcranial direct current stimula- tion (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
tDCS
The mechanisms underlying the effects of tDCS on function are not entirely clear, although studies have shown that application of weak (1 to 4 mA) continuous electrical current to the scalp induces a subthreshold polarization of cortical neurons beneath the stimulated area. The polarization is too weak to generate an action potential, but “primes” the network that is stimulated by the concurrent behavioral task, altering their excitability.125 In this way, tDCS paired with a behavioral task can augment short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Studies in animals and humans have provided evidence that tDCS effects depend on a brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent mecha- nism.126,127 While the influence of the current on polarity of neurons is relatively widely distributed, functional MRI studies reveal that the entire network activated by the concurrent task is modulated when tDCS is applied to any part of the net- work,128 but the excitability is specific to the task-related net- work. Not surprisingly, then, tDCS applied in isolation (without concurrent language task) has no effect on language function in participants with aphasia.129
Double-blind RCTs of tDCS use a sham control that partici- pants are unable to distinguish from real tDCS. The sham con- sists of 30 seconds of 1 to 2 mA stimulation which is faded to 0, mimicking the sensation of continuous (e.g., 20 minutes) 1 to 2 mA stimulation, which is generally perceived for only the initial 20 to 30 seconds.129 RCTs in the last 5 years have evaluated 1 to 2 mA of anodal or cathodal tDCS for 15 to 20 minutes, based on rodent studies by Fritsch et al.126 demonstrating that 15 minutes of continuous tDCS significantly increases BDNF levels for longer than 1 hour. Anodal tDCS consistently increas- es the firing rate of targeted neurons, while cathodal tDCS has mixed effects.129 In humans, over 35 RCTs have been carried out to evaluate anodal or cathodal tDCS (or both) for post-stroke aphasia (see Biou et al.130 in 2019 for a systematic review). The location of electrode placement, language therapy methods, and number of sessions vary across RCTs, although most have used anodal tDCS over left hemisphere language areas, or an- odal or cathodal tDCS over right hemisphere homologues (the latter with the goal to inhibit potentially adverse activity in the

right hemisphere), or use left anodal and right cathodal simul- taneously.
Most trials of tDCS have been carried out in chronic stroke, and most published studies have shown better language out- comes in the tDCS group or condition relative to the sham group or condition in each of these trials, even though both groups generally show some gains with SLT (with or without tDCS; see recent Cochrane review131). For example, one study demonstrated anodal tDCS over the left IFG in conjunction with language therapy resulted in significantly greater improvement compared to sham in picture description (gains of 19.5 vs. 10.6 correct words, P=0.033), noun naming (18.3 vs. 9.2, P=0.024), and verb naming (18.4 vs. 7.3, P=0.019).132 Several studies have reported that anodal tDCS (relative to sham) delivered to motor cortex paired with naming therapy results in greater gains in language outcomes.133,134 The largest (n=74) double-blind RCT of tDCS to augment naming therapy reported significantly greater improvement in accuracy of naming untrained items with tDCS versus sham, each paired with a computer-delivered lexical-se- mantic therapy for 15 sessions.135 Improvement in naming was 70% greater in the left hemisphere anodal tDCS group relative to the sham group: a mean increase in accurately named ob- jects from 13.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.0 to 18.7) for tDCS versus 8.2 (95% CI, 3.8 to 12.6) for sham. Furthermore, there was an interaction between anodal tDCS and polymor- phism of the BDNF gene.127 In the group that received tDCS, participants with the normal val/val polymorphism showed greater response to aphasia therapy than the Met allele carriers, whereas corresponding differences were not revealed among participants in the sham condition.127
Studies of cathodal tDCS to augment SLT have targeted right IFG or right cerebellum. A group of patients who received cathodal tDCS to right IFG with naming therapy showed faster response times in naming compared to the group who received sham plus naming therapy (1.29 to 2.57 seconds, P=0.050),136 consistent with the hypothesis that inhibiting right IFG may facilitate language.137 A few studies have used cathodal (or anodal) tDCS to the right cerebellum with language therapy, based on the cerebellum’s role in language and learning and both inhibitory and excitatory connections between the right cerebellum and left language cortex.138-140 A randomized or- der, double-blind, sham-controlled within-subject cross-over trial of right cerebellar tDCS showed greater improvements in spelling with tDCS versus sham (both with spelling therapy) on trained (from 0% to 52.5% correct vs. 0% to 97.5% correct, P<0.05) and untrained words (0% to 27.5% correct vs. 0% to 82.5% correct, P<0.01).138 Generalization to written picture naming was achieved only after right cerebellar anodal tDCS.

Both tDCS conditions re- sulted in greater improvements than sham from PreTx to PostTx, and sus- tained 2 months later. To see results reported separately for anodal and cathodal tDCS, see reference 111.
More recent data from a randomized order, double-blind cross- over trial of right cerebellar tDCS versus sham, combined with computer-delivered lexical-semantic therapy in 20 participants with chronic post-stroke aphasia by our collaborators showed significantly improved naming of treated items in both condi- tions, but improvement in untreated items only during the tDCS condition (Figure 5).139
The few sham-controlled studies of tDCS+SLT in subacute post-stroke aphasia have shown modest gains with right cathodal tDCS141 or no significant effect with just five therapy sessions.142 However, these studies have shown that 1 to 2 mA tDCS is well-tolerated and safe early after stroke. Additional RCTs in subacute stroke (with more than five therapy sessions) are ongoing.
rTMS
The rTMS is also believed to modulate neuronal activity and en- hance neuroplasticity. Unlike tDCS, rTMS can cause action po- tentials (depending on the frequency), so it can result in chang- es in network connectivity strength in the absence of a behav- ioral task. High frequency rTMS is excitatory, while low frequen- cy rTMS (usually 1 Hz) is inhibitory. In trials to improve lan- guage, low frequency rTMS is generally applied to the contrale- sional right hemisphere to inhibit its activation, which is thought to enhance perilesional left hemisphere activation.137 Likewise, high frequency rTMS is generally applied to left hemi-

 sphere perilesional areas to enhance activation during language. Most rTMS studies include behavioral language intervention immediately after the stimulation. Most RCTs include a sham group or condition, although the conditions are usually distin- guishable by participants who receive both conditions. There- fore, cross-over trials are not generally conducted (but see Ru- bi-Fessen et al.143), as the participants cannot be adequately blinded to the intervention condition. However, randomized, parallel, sham-controlled studies are possible.
In subacute stroke, studies of both low frequency and high frequency rTMS have reported benefits in language recovery. One recent RCT used high frequency rTMS to the left IFG and low frequency rTMS to the right IFG (or bilateral sham) for 10 sessions, each followed by 30 minutes of SLT. The rTMS group showed significantly greater improvements than the sham group in accuracy of word comprehension (P=0.04), naming (P=0.01), repetition (P=0.002), and in aphasia severity (1.8±1.2 vs. 0.9±0.3, P=0.018).144 Significant gains in language with rTMS were ob- served immediately after therapy and 2 months later, and were specific to language. In a pilot, blinded assessor RCT of low fre- quency rTMS (vs. sham) applied to the right IFG for 30 minutes, followed by SLT for 45 minutes, for 10 sessions in 12 patients, the rTMS group showed higher language scores post-treatment (e.g., 50.3±28.3 vs. 39.3±18.1) on a 100-point summary score, despite similar baseline scores. The authors reported a significant time by group interaction but no P-values or CIs were report- ed.145 A larger cross-over study (n=30) of low frequency rTMS (vs. sham) to the right IFG, each with subsequent 45 minutes of language therapy for 10 sessions, also showed greater improve- ment with rTMS compared to sham on object naming (47.4±28.3
vs. 35.3±30.1, P<0.05), object naming reaction time (12.1±4.9 vs. 13.9±5.1, P<0.01), action naming (34.8±24.6 vs. 25.9±20.4, P<0.01), and action naming reaction time (15.4±5.2 vs. 15.4±5.7, P<0.01) immediately after therapy, and lasting up to 3 months, and showed gains in functional communication.146
Similar effects of both low and high frequency rTMS have been reported in studies of chronic post-stroke aphasia (see a Naeser et al.137 for review and Ren et al.147 for a meta-analysis). One recent study first used functional near infrared spectrosco- py to determine which hemisphere showed greater activation during language, to determine the most appropriate frequency of rTMS to right IFG.148 Patients with greater left hemisphere language activation received low frequency (inhibitory) rTMS to contralesional right IFG and those with more right hemisphere language activation received high frequency (excitatory) rTMS to right IFG. All eight patients received language therapy fol- lowing rTMS, for 10 sessions. Equally significant improvements in language functions were observed with low and high fre- quency rTMS to right IFG, but there was no sham control group or condition.
While most rTMS studies for aphasia include language ther- apy immediately after rTMS, one study investigated concurrent versus subsequent language therapy.149 They compared SLT immediately following 1 Hz rTMS to right IFG, to synchronous delivery of language therapy with rTMS, and to language ther- apy alone. Synchronous language therapy was associated with greater improvements in verbal description, object naming, and action naming than either rTMS with subsequent language therapy or sham plus language therapy. The loud clicking noise during rTMS limits the type of language therapy that can be

Conclusions
The mainstay of post-stroke aphasia therapy has always been, and continues to be, behavioral SLT. There have been recent in- novations to enhance its effectiveness, by increasing the time in therapy (e.g., through language therapy apps), by individualizing therapy to address aphasia severity and specific speech or lan- guage deficits, or increasing access to therapy through telere- hab. Behavioral SLT has also been augmented with medications or noninvasive brain stimulation methods that facilitate neural plasticity. Functional imaging studies show changes in neural networks supporting language that correlate with improve- ments. Both animal studies and genetic studies of humans indi- cate that at least tDCS may work through a BDNF-dependent mechanism. Future studies will likely investigate the combina- tion of pharmaceutical and noninvasive brain stimulation ap- proaches to augment SLT. See Figure 6 for a schematic of how interventions lead to reorganization of the language network.
In spite of progress, a major priority for future research in aphasia rehabilitation is to establish ‘minimum clinically sig- nificant differences’ with regard to gains in both language and quality of life. Another important goal is to provide evidence for what therapy works best for patients with specific impairment and/or lesion profiles. A final goal is to identify the optimal dos- age of aphasia therapy. Given that chronic aphasia is associated with especially poor quality of life, even worse than conditions such as cancer,150 we propose a more progressive research agen- da aimed at larger trials with personally meaningful outcomes to establish best practices for aphasia rehabilitation.

The neurological symptoms of stroke have traditionally provided the foundation for functional mapping of the brain. However, there are many unresolved aspects in our understanding of cerebral activity, especially regarding high-level cognitive functions. This review provides a comprehensive look at the pathophysiology of post-stroke cognitive impairment in light of recent findings from advanced imaging techniques. Combining network neuroscience and clinical neurology, our research focuses on how changes in brain networks correlate with post-stroke cognitive prognosis. More specifically, we first discuss the general consequences of stroke lesions due to damage of canonical resting-state large-scale networks or changes in the composition of the entire brain. We also review emerging methods, such as lesion-network mapping and gradient analysis, used to study the aforementioned events caused by stroke lesions. Lastly, we examine other patient vulnerabilities, such as superimposed amyloid pathology and blood-brain barrier leakage, which potentially lead to different outcomes for the brain network compositions even in the presence of similar stroke lesions. This knowledge will allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of post-stroke cognitive impairment and provide a theoretical basis for the development of new treatments, such as neuromodulation.

Introduction
Traditionally, neurological symptoms of stroke have provided a significant basis for understanding the functional mapping of the brain. Studies by Wilder Penfield, Paul Broca, and Carl Wer- nicke have led to a better understanding of various high-level cognitive functions, and the localization of the areas involved in these processes across the brain.1-3 Carl Wernicke suggested that functions such as language, motor, and primary sensory
domains are relatively well localized, while high-level cortical functions, such as memory and execution, seem to depend on the communication among several areas of the brain rather than on a specific region.2 A century later, Wernicke’s hypothe- sis was confirmed through advanced neuroimaging techniques and various computational neuroscience methods.
Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is defined as the oc- currence of any type of cognitive deterioration after stroke, ranging from minor impairment to dementia.4 PSCI has been

 considered a unique clinical entity, distinct from Alzheimer’s disease or subcortical vascular cognitive impairment. As shown by Penfield’s experiments and Wernicke’s lesion study, PSCI is a valuable disease model that can be considered as a “brain le- sion-cognitive disorder.” It has gradually evolved from past ex- perimental studies of patients with specific symptoms that re- vealed the underlying neural substrates, and a great body of related knowledge has been accumulated through lesion- symptom mapping methods. Location of the stroke lesion is one of the most important determinants of the cognitive out- come,5 and collecting lesion data from patients with specific symptoms provides information about the neural substrates affected in each specific case.6,7 In recent studies, lesion-symp- tom mapping has been used to identify the neural substrates of particular cognitive functions,8-10 or predict the prognosis of post-stroke functional deficits, such as aphasia.11 It was also used to study the neural substrates of emotional disorders, such as post-stroke depression, and to understand the inherent limitation of certain cognitive assessment tools.12 Moreover, le- sion-symptom mapping studies have shown that small vessel disease (SVD), as well as stroke lesions, can additionally cause a decrease in the processing speed if distributed in the frontal white matter.6 However, not all neurological symptoms can be localized using lesion-symptom mapping, as the causative re- lationship between lesion and cognitive impairment is not uni- versally applicable. In example, the explanatory power of re- gression model (R2) was 0.35 to 0.58 for motor and visual functions, while limited to 0.06 for verbal memory.13
Fox14 suggested that a network perspective could be a sig- nificant breakthrough in overcoming the limitations of lesion- symptom mapping by showing that there is a network con- necting the lesions at various locations causing the same be- havioral symptoms. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have enabled re- searchers to apply this network approach. In addition, recent advances in imaging have also provided insights into underly- ing vulnerabilities, such as amyloid pathology, SVD, and blood- brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which lead to different cognitive prognosis even in the case of the same stroke lesions.
In this review, we provide a comprehensive look at the pathophysiology of PSCI in light of recent research using ad- vanced imaging techniques. Recent developments in this field are expected to deepen our understanding of the functional localization of brain areas and provide important information on the targets of various neuromodulation techniques. Going one step further from the size or localization of lesions that can be observed with conventional imaging techniques, we fo- cus on how the qualitative and quantitative changes in the
composition of the underlying brain networks can be visual- ized, quantified, and correlated with post-stroke cognitive prognosis. Furthermore, neuroimaging research focusing on amyloid and BBB leakage is important in understanding the adversarial environment caused by underlying diseases, inde- pendent of stroke. These efforts will serve as an important foundation for screening groups at high risk of PSCI, develop- ing appropriate neuromodulation therapy, and determining the treatment outcomes.

Classical studies, including those discussed above, are based on the assumption that stroke lesions cause symptoms by disrupt- ing the function of the corresponding local brain regions. How- ever, due to recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, it has gradually been accepted that the effects of stroke lesions are not confined to the local lesion site. The classical concept of “diaschisis” is a good example of the remote effects of le- sions.15 The concept of remote lesion effects is particularly use- ful when studying the relevance of stroke lesions to cognitive outcomes. For example, it is easy to predict that if a stroke le- sion occurs in the hand knob area, paralysis in the contralateral hand will occur. However, it is not intuitively understood how and why stroke lesions in the anterior thalamic radiation result in cognitive impairment. Lesions in the anterior thalamic radia- tion sever structural connections to the frontal lobe, reducing the frontal cortical thickness, and leading to impairment in frontal cortical functions, including processing speed and ex- ecutive function.6,16 If stroke lesions occur in the hub regions of the well-known intrinsic functional network, their effects can reach a wide range of areas of the brain that are functionally connected, and not only the perilesional areas. Alstott et al.17 visualized this system-wide effect by lesions in the hubs through computational modeling. Clinical studies have also re- ported that cognitive impairment is more likely to arise when lesions occur in the hub region, which mainly corresponds to the heteromodal association cortex.18,19
There are two types of brain connectivity: functional connec- tivity, which can be measured by functional neuroimaging tech- niques, such as resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI); and structural connectivity, which can be measured by structural neuroimag- ing techniques, such as DTI. Research using DTI infers structural connectivity through white matter tracts and covers several ar- eas. Analysis methods for DTI studies range from tractography and tract-based spatial statistics to network models using graph theory.20,21 A recent study using DTI compiled an “Atlas of white matter function” based on 1,333 stroke lesions (available from

https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:7735).22 It has been shown that a “stroke disconnectome” that comprehensively considers the effects of structurally interconnected regions in the brain, rather than only the location of the stroke lesion, bet- ter describes the cognitive prognosis of patients with subcorti- cal stroke. These results emphasize that subcortical lesions can also lead to a decline in higher cognitive functions, which were traditionally thought to be the exclusively caused by cortical le- sions, and that the disruption of white matter connectivity can be an important mechanism underlying this phenomenon. On the other hand, network studies using rs-fMRI have identified that key brain regions can be functionally affected by lesions even if they are not structurally connected.13,14 In recent years, an “indirect lesion-network mapping” methodology has been proposed to study the network-wide effects of local lesions by applying the normative functional connectivity maps obtained from healthy individuals to the patient’s lesion location without directly taking rs-fMRIs from stroke patients.14
In the following sections, we introduce these approaches from a clinical perspective and discuss the main considerations derived from each representative study. Network analysis in stroke research can be classified into two main perspectives. The first is to examine how stroke lesions result in changes in the intrinsic brain networks and how these changes relate to cognitive prognosis. The second is to look at the brain as a sin- gle integrated system and determine how the composition of this system changes and how such changes relate to cognitive function. In this review, we first focus on the role of brain con- nectivity in the pathophysiology of PSCI from a reductionist perspective, considering changes in several representative large-scale brain networks. We then move to a more holistic perspective, analyzing the brain network as a complex system. Lastly, we discuss the underlying vulnerabilities that can lead to differences in network configurations between patients with the same lesions.
From part to whole (I): a reductionist perspective
fMRI is a common research tool used to identify neural sub- strates by administering a certain task to an individual and an- alyzing the resulting signal changes. Thus, it has been the foundation of cognitive neuroscience research. However, it is not easy to analyze complex cognitive tasks during functional imaging in patients with stroke sequelae. From this perspective, the analysis of fMRI signals from the resting state, without the assignment of any specific task, has clinical utility. Previous studies suggested that network activity was consistently ob- served during the resting state, and the corresponding net- works were called resting-state networks (RSNs).23 These RSN
include default mode, central executive, dorsal attention, and salience networks.24 Typical canonical networks have been studied in a variety of fields, such as normal aging, schizophre- nia, depression, pain, and Alzheimer disease.25,26 A comprehen- sive review of the association between cognition and RSNs goes beyond the scope of this manuscript; thus, we recom- mend that the readers refer to recent review papers.27-29
With regard to RSNs, a previous study, that applied lesion mapping methods, has shown that the involvement of major hubs within the default mode network and the central executive network increases the risk of developing post-stroke global cog- nitive impairment,19 while another study directly examined changes in the activity of those hubs using rs-fMRI data in pa- tients with stroke.30 These hubs include the medial temporal and hippocampal regions, which are already known as strategic re- gions, and the posterior parietal cortex, which is the heteromodal association cortex, as suggested by computational modeling17 and principal component analysis of connectivity hierarchy.31
Siegel et al.32 analyzed the communication between RSNs, as well as the activities of individual RSNs. Resting-state fMRI was performed in 132 patients with stroke and 31 matched controls, along with comprehensive cognitive evaluations at 1 to 3 weeks after stroke. Moreover, stroke consequences on 13 canonical RSNs and their relationships with cognitive progno- sis were analyzed. They found that primary motor and vision- related functions were dependent on specific RSNs, but higher cognitive functions, such as attention and memory, were more dependent on the communication between several RSNs than on the function of any individual RSN (Figure 1). Wernicke’s prediction, quoted earlier, was proven using advanced neuro- imaging techniques 100 years later.
In summary, lesions in each region of the brain have differen- tial effects on cognitive functions, and these differences should be understood from a network perspective, rather than focusing only on the location of the lesion itself. Damage to the highly connected hubs within each network, or changes in communi- cation between RSNs, were associated with the occurrence of PSCI. However, other studies on PSCI have attempted to explain the mechanisms of cognitive decline after stroke as a change in the overall structure and information transfer efficiency of the brain rather than applying the RSN perspective. In the next sec- tion, we discuss this second approach.
From part to whole (II): brain as a complex system–a holistic perspective
In addition to the RSN-based approach described above, imag- ing analysis techniques can model the brain as a single com- plex system. For example, the graph theory is a mathematical

approach that allows us to represent a complex network sys- tem in the form of simple lines (i.e., edges) and dots (i.e., nodes) and to extract some representative quantities that can reflect its characteristics.33 Graph theory has been used not only in neuroscience, but also in various other disciplines, such as so- cial science and genetic association. For more information on graph theory, please refer to the review articles and books by Sporns,27 Rubinov and Sporns,33 and Bullmore and Sporns.34 In this section, we discuss the pathogenesis of PSCI through stud- ies that have applied this holistic perspective.
Network attributes and post-stroke cognition
Integration and segregation are important concepts in under- standing the brain as a network system (Figure 2A).33 Integra- tion is defined as “the ability to rapidly combine specialized in- formation from distributed brain regions,” and characteristic path length and global efficiency are well-known indicators of integration.33 Segregation, defined as “the ability for special- ized processing to occur within densely interconnected groups of brain regions,” is an indicator that quantifies the functional units within a network.33 Representative attributes of segrega- tion include clustering coefficient, transitivity, and modularity.
In addition to these quantification measures, several methods to directly visualize functionally compartmentalized communi- ty structures have also been proposed.35,36 In brief, segregation means that functions such as language and vision are confined to a particular group of brain regions, while integration refers to the ability of these areas to communicate with each other more comprehensively from a brain-wide perspective. Figure 2B shows how stroke lesions can lead to changes in integration and segregation. In the following sections, modularity, which is closely related to PSCI, is discussed in detail.
Modules, modularity, and system segregation: an indicator for functional segregation
A module represents a functionally compartmentalized unit in the brain.33 As such, modularity is an indicator of the fact that functionally related brain regions exhibit highly correlated ac- tivity within the network and less correlated activity with other networks. This is a known strategy used by the brain to effi- ciently process the flow of information and maintain the brain functions that the network is responsible for.37 Figure 2A and B show the relationship between the module and hub, and how focal lesions, such as strokes, change the cerebral network

configuration. Stroke lesions can have different outcomes de- pending on the location of the lesion. In the case of the upper panel of Figure 2B, segregation is maintained, but integration is reduced as a consequence of decreased connectivity be- tween functionally partitioned modules. However, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 2B, a decrease in segregation can also occur without significant changes in integration. These changes can be widespread, disrupting the information flow not only in the peri-infarction area, but throughout the brain, and even in the contralesional hemisphere.38,39
Changes in these modules and hubs have been studied in relation to cognitive impairment after stroke. Siegel et al.36 performed an rs-fMRI study in stroke patients at 2 weeks (107 subjects), 3 months (85 subjects), and 1 year (67 subjects) af- ter stroke. Modularity significantly decreased during the sub- acute period and then partially recovered during the subse- quent period. In addition, the recovery of modularity led to the improvement of cognitive functions, such as language, spatial memory, and attention, but not to the recovery of motor and visual functions. In a task-based fMRI study of 15 patients with left hemispheric stroke with aphasia, the correlation be- tween written language production accuracy and modularity was examined.40 Although global integration was maintained, patients with poor local integrity and modularity had more
severe symptoms and poor response to treatment. Separately, the modularity and local integrity of the central occipital- temporal regions related to spelling function improved after treatment.
In addition, Chan et al.41 introduced the “system segregation” variable to quantify the degree of segregation of the brain. They demonstrated that changes in system segregation due to aging were significantly associated with episodic memory function. They suggested that “system segregation” can be a good indicator of higher cognitive function, as even younger subjects would display poor memory in the presence of low system segregation, while even the elderly displayed good memory function if they had high system segregation.
Although the changes in segregation due to stroke lesions were mostly interpreted from a pathological perspective, it was also suggested that these segregated brain structures could prevent the spread of damage caused by focal brain lesions. In other words, some researchers suggested an additional role of brain segregation in isolating brain damage within a specific module to minimize its impact, thereby preventing the overall deterioration of brain function.37,42
These studies, which are related to modularity, within-net- work connectivity, and system segregation, are good examples of how neuroplasticity occurs in the brain during post-stroke

treatment, and suggest that advanced neuroimaging tech- niques, such as fMRI, can provide clinically useful information.
Hubness: integration throughout the brain
Along with changes in the composition of modules in the brain, the brain-wide effects of stroke lesions depend on the involvement of the hub regions, as illustrated in Figure 2C. Hubs play a crucial role in the flow of information between modules, which results in wider intracerebral functional changes when compromised. In the figure, lesions in the hubs (blue circle) have a more pronounced effect on the overall net- work configuration compared to those not involving hubs, in addition to the destruction of the module themselves (ex- pressed in each color).39
Aben et al.43 quantified the hubness to study its association with PSCI. DTI and cognitive tests were performed in the 5th week after ischemic stroke in 75 patients, and cognitive tests were repeated 1 year later to evaluate recovery. The hub scores of gray matter regions, segmented into 90 regions on the brain network map, were obtained from 44 cognitively normal indi- viduals. The proportion of volume of the region affected by the stroke lesion was calculated and multiplied by the hub score of the region, thus obtaining a “lesion impact score,” that would index the influence of the lesion. This study showed that the lower the lesion impact score, the better the cognitive progno- sis 1 year after stroke onset. Moreover, it underlined a negative correlation between the lesion impact score and global effi- ciency, demonstrating that a lesion invading a hub clearly af- fects the overall brain network integration.
Interplay between segregation and integration
The relationship between segregation and integration is also a significant issue. Previous studies have reported that function-
ally segregated sensorimotor systems are loosened during the aging process.41 In the case of the cingulo-opercular control system, within-system connectivity decreases after middle age, but between-system connectivity increases, which is consid- ered a compensatory change. In other words, once the densely segmented network becomes loose, it starts enhancing system- wide information transfer as a coping mechanism. In patients with stroke, the same process may occur during the recovery process after the lesion is formed. The intra-network connectiv- ity of the lesioned module is weakened and dispersed; however, between-network connectivity with functionally adjacent net- works can be increased (Figure 3). The initial decrease in modu- larity after brain damage (as described in section ‘Modules, modularity, and system segregation: an indicator for functional segregation’) is also in line with this pathological change.36 Poor prognosis may occur if these compensation mechanisms are not properly implemented. Guo et al.44 studied the imbal- ance between segregation and integration in 17 patients with post-stroke aphasia. In this study, both parameters were de- creased compared to those of healthy controls. This disruption of intra-hemispheric networks in language-relevant regions without compensation was significantly correlated with the aphasia quotient. In addition, Wang et al.45 studied dynamic functional network connectivity using time-varying analysis methods in 58 patients with pontine stroke. They showed that patients with pontine stroke spent less time in a highly segre- gated state, which was associated with long-term low verbal memory scores. These results suggest that abnormal functional segregation and integration can also be observed in patients with infratentorial stroke. Furthermore, Xu et al.46 revealed that regional connectivity was disrupted in the cognitive and limbic systems in patients with post-stroke depression, while global efficiency was increased. The abnormal segregation-integration

In the lower left and right panels, the principal connectivity gradient explaining most of the variance in the connectivity data was represented as separate layers. It usually follows the well-known axis of unimodal (e.g., visual, somatomotor networks; periphery; green-colored circles) to heteromodal (e.g., default mode network; core; red-colored circles) hierarchy of the brain.
relationship also led to changes in small-worldness, which is defined as the ratio between clustering coefficient (segrega- tion) and characteristic path length (integration). In layman terms “small-worldness” can be regarded as the degree to which functionally clustered metropolitan cities (segregation) are connected with a small number of highways (integration). There is a debate regarding the relationship between small- worldness and post-stroke functional outcomes. Blaschke et al.47 demonstrated that acute stroke induces an abrupt increase in small-worldness across both humans and rodents, and the augmented small-worldness is significantly correlated with be- havioral deficits. Van Meer et al.48 also indicated that small- worldness was increased when stroke was induced in mice. On the contrary, Siegel et al.36 reported that small-worldness de- creased in patients with acute stroke. Since the results may differ depending on the lesion characteristics and timing of the evaluations,36 further research is needed to reveal the effects of the complex interplay between segregation and integration on post-stroke changes in cognitive function.
Hierarchy of network structures
In addition to the concepts discussed above, taking into ac- count the existence of a cortical hierarchy has proven impor-
tant in understanding the effects of lesions on cognitive func- tions. It has been suggested that the composition of brain net- works is not all at the same level, and some major axes form the brain’s functional hierarchy (Figure 4).31
Cortical gradient analysis is a projection of the entire brain’s connectivity to low-dimensional subspaces aimed at revealing the representative patterns of connectivity.49,50 In other words, the connectivity gradients reflect the underlying structure of functional similarity between cortical regions, and this approach has led to an understanding of the functional composition of the brain.31 The principal connectivity gradient, explaining most of the variance in connectivity data, usually follows the well- known unimodal (e.g., visual, somatomotor networks which processes concrete information) to heteromodal (e.g., default mode network, which processing abstract information) hierar- chy of the brain.31,49 With these connectivity gradients as the reference axes, the macroscale change of brain network topolo- gies, such as system segregation, can be explored. For example, one can analyze the distance between brain regions that were originally close enough in the gradient subspaces to be assigned the same canonical brain module in healthy controls. This mea- sure is called the “dispersion” score, and the increase of disper- sion after stroke suggests that the functional segregation of a

http://j-stroke.org 303

 network is presumably weakened due to pathological process- es.51 Moreover, when the dispersion of frontoparietal, attention, and default mode networks were increased by aging, cognitive function also declined at the same time.50
Bayrak et al.50 investigated the impact of ischemic stroke le- sions on connectivity gradients. They reported that the degree of functional connectivity changes due to stroke lesions de- pends on the connectivity gradient, rather than the anatomical distance from the lesion. Functional alterations in closely relat- ed regions in the cortical gradient space were significantly as- sociated with stroke severity and functional prognosis at dis- charge after stroke.50
Graphical representation: usefulness and limitations
To adequately evaluate aspects of these complex relationships, attempts are being made to not only represent them as a dis- tinct parameter but also to visualize them as intuitive figures. These visualization methods enable us to identify the commu- nity structures of the brain and examine the spatial interac- tions of each brain region, such as core-periphery structures and hierarchical relationships (Figures 2 and 4). By calculating the strength of connectivity between each pair of nodes and representing it as a distance, it is possible to distinguish func- tionally independent major communities, which can be visual- ized through intuitive methods, such as spring-embedded fig- ures (Figure 3). These methods can help understand the net- work structures, especially when evaluating longitudinal changes in one individual,41 or when comparing groups. Al- though these brain network visualization methods are also be- ing used in individual patients,52 visualizing these spatial con- figurations carries the risk of misinterpretation and mathemat- ical bias, due to the high-dimensional nature of neuroimaging data. Thus, graphical representations are still commonly used when evaluating differences between groups.
Recently, two approaches have been explored to overcome the limitations of the visualization process: (1) developing bet- ter dimensionality reduction methods to minimize bias and en- hance interpretability,49 and (2) expanding the amount of data by increasing the acquisition time of rs-fMRI.35 First, there are many well-known linear dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis32,53 and independent component analysis.54 Furthermore, new nonlinear dimension- ality reduction methods have recently been proposed to better reflect and represent nonlinear manifolds for data visualiza- tion, such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding,55 and uniform manifold approximation and projection.56 In addi- tion, many different parcellations have been developed.57-60 Such dimensionality reduction methods should help to accu-
rately visualize each individual patient’s high-dimensional net- work structure with minimal bias. Moreover, they can help re- solve multiple-comparison issues, improving the statistical power and sensitivity.
Second, the “precision functional mapping” approach utilizes a large amount of fMRI data from one individual, allowing us to obtain more robust features from individual’s raw data and estimate more precise models of individualized functional brain networks.61,62 For example, a previous study acquired around 11 hours of rs-fMRI data per participant to examine precise func- tional brain architectures, and demonstrated that these func- tional brain connectomes are not only highly reliable within individual but also unique and distinct with each other.35 This approach has allowed the visualization of differences in the order and arrangement of each major node in individual pa- tients. These visualization methods allow the identification of qualitative aspects of detailed network structures, which can- not be determined only by certain attributes, such as global ef- ficiency, modularity, and system segregation. A recent study, using precision functional mapping, showed that the functional reorganization of the hand motor area consists of a specific re- mapping around the infarcted tissue after a large bilateral stroke.52 Despite these advantages, to ensure the reliability of the analysis, rs-fMRI images must be obtained for at least 30 minutes; thus, there are still limitations to the application of this method to patients with stroke in clinical practice, consid- ering the cost and time involved. Once the individual functional mapping of each stroke patient becomes more reliable and re- producible, network analysis will be adopted in the clinical field as part of a precision medicine approach.
Inference vs. observation: indirect and direct mapping
Lesion-network mapping has recently attracted more and more attention. In most functional network studies, fMRIs were tak- en directly from patients and analyzed.32 For example, Siegel et al.32 obtained rs-fMRI data from more than 100 patients to confirm the correlation between each cognitive domain score and well-known RSNs. Although fMRI is a sophisticated ana- lytic method, it is usually extremely difficult to obtain rs-fMRI data from patients, as fMRI requires limited movement for a long time in patients with stroke. Moreover, it is challenging to recruit a sufficient number of individuals for proper mathemat- ical modeling.
To overcome these drawbacks, Fox et al.14 proposed a meth- od called lesion-network mapping. This method uses a suffi- cient number of rs-fMRIs from normal volunteers to create a

normative functional connectivity map, and then overlaps the location of lesions in stroke patients with specific neurological symptoms to determine the network effects that are induced by each infarction.14 Several such studies applying this method have been recently published,63-65 along with reviews discuss- ing the limitations of the process.13,66-68
The original purpose of the study by Darby et al.,63 Laganiere et al.,64 and Boes et al.65 was to identify the neural substrates of peculiar neurological symptoms, which are difficult to iden- tify by conventional lesion-symptom mapping methods, such as chorea and delusional misidentification. To this end, they focused on comparing patients with specific neurological symptoms and controls without those symptoms. The research- ers also used the data of nearly 1,000 normal participants of the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP) to reconstruct normative connectivity maps.69 However, in the study by the Corbetta group, rs-fMRI images were taken directly in patients with stroke to create mathematical models predictive of cogni- tive test scores and verify their explanatory power.32,36
The Corbetta group13 showed that the lesion-network map- ping was actually less predictive of cognitive prognosis than the direct functional imaging, structural connectivity imaging, and lesion location information itself. Thus, lesion-network mapping cannot replace the conventional methods based on data obtained directly from patients.13 They proved their argu- ment using 7-T rs-fMRI data of 132 individuals from the Hu- man Connectome Project to reconstruct indirect lesion-net- work mapping, known as functional disconnectome, and com- paring the prognostic power for PSCI using four methods: le- sion information, structural disconnectome, direct functional disconnectome, and indirect functional disconnectome. In their results, the indirect lesion-network mapping showed the low- est predictive power for PSCI.13
In response, Cohen et al.66 conducted a study to evaluate the predictive power of the same four methods using different pop- ulation-based and analytic approaches. In contrast to the study by Salvalaggio et al.,13 the authors reconstructed the indirect functional disconnectome using 3-T MRI data from 1,000 indi- viduals from the Human Connectome Project and focused on lesion location data. When the modeling was performed, apply- ing the leave-one-out method and the “lesion mask” for each patient, the predictive power of the indirect functional discon- nectome for behavioral outcomes showed an R2 value similar to that of the lesion information-based approach.
The details of the technical points go beyond the scope of this review, but this debate demonstrates the recent develop- ments and growing interest in analytic methods using rs-fMRI in the field of stroke. Upon further implementation, these meth-
ods may become an important tool for easier screening, assess- ment, and identification of patients at high risk of PSCI, as well as facilitating research related to therapeutic intervention.
Vulnerability
So far, we have mainly considered the relationship between le- sions and cognitive function. However, it is commonly observed that even similar-sized lesions occurring in similar locations may have different prognosis among patients. Therefore, fur- ther research is needed to elucidate the interactions between patients’ underlying vulnerabilities and stroke lesions on net- work functions (Figure 5). Such vulnerabilities include the pa- tient’s age, sex, cognitive reserve, and comorbidities. Recent studies have worked on developing a new method that visual- izes the underlying pathological processes, which are not ob- served with conventional images.
It is well known that amyloid pathology accelerates cogni- tive decline after stroke. Among patients with stroke, those with positive amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) re- sults showed more distinct cognitive decline than those with- out them in a 3-year follow-up study.70 This finding has been

 replicated through a longitudinal study in patients with sub- cortical vascular cognitive impairment, that had SVD without overt clinical stroke.71 However, some studies have reported that severe SVD is more important than amyloid pathology for long-term cognitive decline after stroke.72 Thus far, it seems clear that amyloid pathology has a detrimental effect on cog- nitive decline after stroke, although it is necessary to pay at- tention to the definition of the patient group, evaluation method, and follow-up period when interpreting these results. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that stroke itself alters amyloid PET findings, requiring caution in interpretation. In pa- tients with recent infarction, the peri-infarct region had a rela- tive increase in Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention com- pared with the contralateral mirror region, but no increase in global PiB retention.73 An animal study has shown a transitive increase in amyloid plaques around infarct areas, possibly re- flecting the impairment of the amyloid clearance pathway around the infarcted tissue.74 Some researchers argue that such findings may be the result of free PiB leakage due to the BBB damage of the peri-infarct tissue, which requires careful inter- pretation.73 If the rapidly developing peripheral blood biomark- ers for amyloid and tau are evaluated for this purpose, it will be possible to confirm the effect of these superimposed amy- loid and tau pathology on cognitive impairment after stroke in a more multifaceted manner.75
BBB disruption has been studied in a variety of neurological disorders, including SVD, and several neurodegenerative dis- eases. However, BBB disruption cannot be easily evaluated us- ing conventional imaging techniques. Thrippleton et al.76 visu- alized BBB leakage through dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in patients with lacunar infarction. Although the le- sion identified by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) was a small lacuna, DCE-MRI shows that ipsilesional hemi- spheres were accompanied by more extensive BBB changes. Further research is still needed to determine whether this change is a temporary phenomenon, how long it lasts, and whether it is related to functional prognosis; however, it has an important implication in terms of the underlying vulnerabilities of the patient’s cognitive outcome, which would be difficult to identify based only on the lacunae number and location.
A recent study reported that a “free water” indicator of DTI showed a significant negative correlation with memory and frontal executive function even before the changes in fraction- al anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) appeared. It was suggested that the DTI free water may represent a subtle breakdown of the BBB.77 DTI has the advantage of eliminating the need for a contrast medium, unlike DCE-MRI, and has been shown to reflect white matter pathology ahead of changes in
FA and white matter hyperintensities.78 DTI free water has also been reported to have increased in the substantia nigra of Par- kinson’s disease patients, as well as in the basal ganglia and thalamus of patients with other Parkinson syndromes, includ- ing multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear pal- sy.79 Because it can reflect various pathological mechanisms, further studies are needed to elucidate the exact relationship between DTI free water and BBB disruption.77
As mentioned earlier, it has been suggested that SVD is re- lated to delayed cognitive decline after stroke.72 The severity of SVD is an important determinant for PSCI, but the importance of the strategic location of SVD has also been suggested.19,80 A recently developed advanced imaging method, which can re- flect the pathological changes of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), is also expected to provide clarity regarding the vulnerability of patients after stroke. Cerebrovascular reac- tivity in the NAWM around leukoaraiosis was reduced,81 and BBB permeability was increased in the NAWM, prior to the de- velopment of white matter lesions.82 Microstructural altera- tions, reflected by high MD and low FA in DTI, were associated with poor processing speed and global cognition.83 Determining the extent of pathological processes in white matter regions prior to stroke is important for accurate prediction of cognitive prognosis and screening of patients for treatment. Another SVD marker is microinfarct, defined as a small lesion with less than 5 mm of T1 low and T2 high signal intensities in the cor- tical regions.84 van Veluw et al.84 verified in an autopsy study that these lesions, observed with 7-T MRI, were actually micro- infarcts. These microinfarcts were more frequently found in patients with Alzheimer’s disease than in healthy controls, and also showed a strong association with vascular dementia.85 Their presence was closely related to the deterioration of vi- suoconstructive and language functions, along with global cognition. It is noteworthy that these microinfarcts can also be observed with 3-T MRI.86 Microinfarcts were identified using T2, T1, and FLAIR of 3-T MRI in 34 out of 231 stroke patients within 1 week (14.7%) and significantly correlated with atrial fibrillation and confluent white matter hyperintensities. The authors suggested that microinfarcts may be related to micro- embolism and cerebral SVD. In terms of cognitive outcomes, they showed a significant correlation with visuospatial domain changes. In addition, perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are SVD markers that reflect the vulnerability of individual patients.87,88

many outstanding challenges remain to be solved. In particu- lar, the importance of cooperative research has recently emerged, as lesion-symptom mapping studies require a larger number of patients to provide wider lesion coverage. In addi- tion, to investigate changes in the network structures while considering the diversity of stroke lesions and patient-specific characteristics, a large number of patients with well-described clinical features are needed. Multidisciplinary cooperation is also required as it impossible for clinicians to be familiar with all the sophisticated analysis methods that are being continu- ously developed.
Several representative international consortia have been re- cently formed to study the pathogenesis of PSCI. Among them, the Meta VCI Map obtained large amounts of lesion location information through 12 acute ischemic stroke cohorts, and also refined the lesion-symptom mapping analysis method.10 Stroke and Cognition Consortium (STROKOG) is another international consortium of longitudinal studies of PSCI that has presented important results from epidemiological and clinical studies of PSCI.89,90 The “Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Out- comes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY)” is a consortium formed in North America, which plans to obtain multimodal data from over 8,000 patients, aiming to identify high-risk groups and the determinants of PSCI (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04916210).
fMRI and DTI are important research methods, but they have several drawbacks when applied to patients with stroke. These imaging techniques are burdensome for widespread im- plementation in patients with stroke, as they require a long scan time and are vulnerable to in-scanner movement. On the other hand, electroencephalography (EEG) is more affordable and easier to apply to patients; thus, it would be a good alter- native for the study of network changes due to stroke, if reli- able analysis techniques can be established for EEG.
The studies discussed in this review mainly focused on the pathophysiology of PSCI, but their final aim was therapeutic intervention. In particular, research from a network perspec- tive will provide important information on neuromodulation. Grefkes and Fink38 conducted fMRI imaging at various time points, i.e. as 1, 3, 7, and 90 days after stroke, and showed in- teresting results regarding the longitudinal changes in brain functional connectivity around the stroke lesion. In their study, activation of the contralateral homologous regions showed a suppressive effect in the early days after stroke onset, but a beneficial effect as time passed. This result has important im- plications for future neuromodulation targets and treatment windows. We do not yet know which stroke patients should be treated with neuromodulation and what is the optimal timing
for the intervention. Further studies are required to provide critical information regarding this therapeutic intervention.
Conclusions
New imaging studies, as we have shown above, have increased knowledge on the patho-mechanisms of PSCI. Advances in classical lesion-symptom mapping techniques continue to re- veal the localization of each cognitive domain in more sophis- ticated ways. In addition, novel methods have been imple- mented to comprehensively examine the disruption of func- tional and structural connections within the brain, caused by focal lesions, as well as the related changes in the brain sys- tem. Various graphical representations are useful to understand the detailed changes in network configuration induced by focal lesions. In addition, new information on the vulnerabilities that interfere with the recovery mechanism have been collected. International collaborations can deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of PSCI and ultimately allow us to take a fur- ther step in the development of therapeutic interventions.

Background and Purpose The present study aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of dif- ferent blood pressure (BP)-lowering strategies.
Methods Randomized controlled trials that compared various antihypertensive treatments and stroke outcomes were included. Eligible trials were categorized into three scenarios: single or com- bination antihypertensive agents against placebos; single or combination agents against other agents; and different BP-lowering targets. The primary efficacy outcome was the risk reduction pertaining to strokes. The tolerability outcome was the withdrawal of drugs, owing to drug-related side effects (PROSPERO registration number CRD42018118454 [20/12/2018]).
Results The present study included 93 trials (average follow-up duration, 3.3 years). In the pairwise analysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and beta-blockers (BBs) were inferior to calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (odds ratio [OR], 1.123; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.008 to 1.252) (OR, 1.261; 95% CI, 1.116 to 1.425) for stroke prevention, BB was inferior to angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) (OR, 1.361; 95% CI, 1.142 to 1.622), and diuretics were superior to ACEi (OR, 0.871; 95% CI, 0.771 to 0.984). The combination of ACEi+CCB was superior to ACEi+diuretic (OR, 0.892; 95% CI, 0.823 to 0.966). The network meta-analysis confirmed that diuretics were su- perior to BB (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.58), ACEi+diuretic (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.08), BB+C- CB (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.79), and renin inhibitors (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.75) for stroke prevention. Regarding the tolerability profile, the pairwise analysis revealed that ACEi was inferior to CCB and less tolerable, compared to the other treatments.
Conclusions Monotherapy using diuretics, CCB, or ARB, and their combinations could be employed as first-line treatments for stroke prevention in terms of efficacy and tolerability.

 Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality across the globe. In 2017, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death, after ischemic heart disease, and caused 6.2 million deaths worldwide.1 Moreover, hypertension is a leading cause of stroke and the significance of blood pressure (BP) lowering in stroke prevention is already established in literature.2 Consider- ing the high prevalence of stroke, achievement of the most ap- propriate or ideal BP could have a significant impact on public health.
A recent meta-analysis reported that the reduction in sys- tolic blood pressure (SBP) by 10 mm Hg was associated with a 27% reduction in the risk associated with stroke.3 Moreover, the magnitude of reduction in BP was linearly associated with the extent of risk reduction pertaining to recurrent strokes.4 A systematic review of the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA)/Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC)/American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM)/Ameri- can Geriatrics Society (AGS)/American Pharmacists Association (APhA)/American Society of Hematology (ASH)/American So- ciety for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC)/National Medical Asso- ciation (NMA)/Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association (PCNA) guidelines for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high BP in adults (the 2017 high BP guide- lines) has recommended intensive BP-lowering treatments (to a target of below 130 mm Hg) other than the standard anti- hypertensive therapies.5 However, despite the well-established and widespread use of BP-lowering agents for the prevention of stroke, the most appropriate treatments pertaining to various populations are still under debate. A meta-analysis published in 2016 demonstrated that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were superior to other drugs for the prevention of stroke in the general population.3 A systematic review of the 2017 high BP guidelines employed network meta-analysis and reported that thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics (THZs) were associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke in patients with hyperten- sion.5 Another meta-analysis reported that CCBs were at least as effective as the other first-line antihypertensive agents in the management of hypertensive patients with a previous history of stroke.6 Nevertheless, previous meta-analyses have rarely involved the comprehensive analysis of the most appropriate antihypertensive agents for different target populations. More- over, previous meta-analyses did not consider the tolerability and safety profiles pertaining to the antihypertensive strategies. Furthermore, combined antihypertensive strategies were rec- ommended by several guidelines, in order to achieve better BP
control and to slow the progression of hypertension. However, previous studies provided limited evidence on the efficacy of combined antihypertensive therapies in stroke prevention.
Traditional meta-analysis could only compare the treatments assessed in the same study, whereas network meta-analysis could compare multiple treatments from different studies through common comparators. Consequently, several treat- ments could be ranked.7,8 Hence, the present study performed a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and tolerability profiles of both single and combined antihypertensive strategies for stroke prevention in different populations.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
The present meta-analysis adhered to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis PRISMA) state- ment9 and the PRISMA network meta-analysis extension state- ment.10 The current study used an existing strategy11 with addi- tional items, such as cerebrovascular disorders, stroke, brain in- farction, cerebral infarction, brain ischemia, cerebral hemor- rhage, or intracranial hemorrhage, in order to identify the rele- vant trials from the Pubmed database, published during the time period from January 1, 1966 to December 1, 2018. The de- tailed search terms are provided in Appendix 1. The present study restricted the search to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) alone without any language restrictions. The Cochrane Collaboration database was also searched. Furthermore, in order to identify eligible studies, the present study performed a man- ual inspection of the reference list pertaining to the studies in- cluded in the review. Subsequently, a manual examination was performed to ascertain whether each trial reported stroke as a primary or secondary outcome. Studies that fulfilled the follow- ing criteria were included in the current meta-analysis: (1) RCTs; (2) greater than 1,000 patient-years of follow-up in each study group; (3) trials that reported stroke as the primary or secondary outcome; and (4) trials that used antihypertensive drugs for in- dications other than the management of hypertension such as proteinuria. Eligible trials were extracted and categorized into three scenarios: single, or a combination antihypertensive agents against placebos, single, or combination agents against others, and different BP-lowering targets. Trials that document- ed the presence of baseline comorbidities were not excluded.
Data extraction and quality assessment
The literature search, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two researchers (X.L.Z. and Y.D.). In case of disagreements, consensus was achieved through

the referral to a third reviewer (J.T.Y.). Data were extracted into specially designed Excel sheets that listed the baseline charac- teristics pertaining to each group, which is provided in Supple- mentary Table 1.
The primary efficacy outcome was measured by the incidence of stroke. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, car- diovascular-related deaths, all strokes (fatal or nonfatal), fatal or disabling stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke by groups. The tolerability outcome was measured by the with- drawal, owing to drug-related side effects.
The quality of each study was critically appraised by the two researchers who performed the literature review, on the basis of a 7-point tool, in order to assess the risk of bias using the Co- chrane Collaboration tool.12
Statistical analysis
The present study performed the meta-analysis in two steps. First, a traditional meta-analysis was performed to clarify the effects of antihypertensive agents on the odds ratio (OR) of var- ious outcomes. Second, a pairwise and network analysis was performed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of all antihy- pertensive agents in stroke prevention.
Effects of BP-lowering for various outcomes
In this step, the present study combined the trials involving an- tihypertensive agents versus placebos and higher versus lower BP-lowering targets, and performed a traditional meta-analysis. The OR was estimated from the number of events and partici- pants pertaining to each outcome in each trial and pooled re- sults with the Mantel-Haenszel and Hartung-Knapp adjustment for random effects models. The magnitude of the statistical heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using the stan- dard Cochrane chi-square test. Subgroup analyses were strati- fied by age, history of stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, baseline SBP levels, and achieved SBP level. Publication bias was evaluated both graphically using a funnel plot and us- ing the Egger statistical test for funnel plot asymmetry,13 if a minimum of 10 studies were available for each outcome. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed to determine whether any one study had a disproportionately large impact on the pooled OR.
Results
In the present study, a total of 93 RCTs met the inclusion crite- ria, which enrolled 504,613 participants with an average fol- low-up period of 3.3 years and provided sufficient data to be included in the traditional or network meta-analysis (Figure 1). Among the aforementioned studies, 66 were deemed to be tri-

withdrawal, owing to drug-related side effects. First, a pairwise meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model to analyze direct treatment comparisons. Heterogeneity was as- sessed using the I2 metric. Second, the present study analyzed the pooled data pertaining to all BP-lowering treatments with random effects models within a Bayesian framework in Open- BUGS (http://openbugs.net).14 The details pertaining to the OpenBUGS codes that were used in the study are shown in Ap- pendix 2. A valid network meta-analysis will satisfy the as- sumption of transitivity. Differences between the direct and in- direct comparisons could suggest that the transitivity assump- tion might not hold. The present study assessed the evidence consistency in the networks in two ways. One was the node- split approach to contrast direct evidence with indirect evidence from the entire network on each node.15-17 The other was the design-by-treatment interaction model that provided a single inference, using the chi-square test, regarding the plausibility of assuming consistency throughout the entire network.18 The sur- face under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and ranko- grams were used to provide a hierarchy of the regimens.19 The two-dimensional plots and clustering methods were conducted to obtain meaningful groups of the treatments.20 In addition, the current study assessed the small study effects using com- parison adjusted funnel plot symmetry.20
Sensitivity analyses
In order to examine the generalizability of the findings, the present study assessed for the effects of different trials and par- ticipant characteristics on the outcomes of sensitivity analyses by restricting the analyses to studies with the following design characteristics: hypertensive participants, no heart failure, pub- lished in or after 2000, and duration of follow-up of more than 3 years. The present study performed the subgroup analyses, in accordance with the age, history of stroke, history of diabetes, and baseline SBP. More details about the statistical analysis are shown in Supplementary methods.
Traditional meta-analyses were performed using R version 3.4.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and network meta-analyses were performed using OpenBUGS 3.2.3 and STATA 14.0 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA).

 als pertaining to the lowering of BP (52 compared a single BP-lowering agent against a placebo; 14 compared different BP-lowering targets) and they were included in the analysis to explore the association between the BP-lowering treatments and various outcomes. Among the 64 studies, 44 focused on patients above the age of 60 years. Four studies involved partic- ipants without any prior history of stroke and five studies in- cluded participants with a previous history of stroke. A total of 82 trials with 14 different BP-lowering strategies were included to compare the efficacy of the treatments. Six drug classes, alone or in combination, were compared with each other or the

placebos. Among the 82 studies, five studies focused on partici- pants without any prior history of stroke, whereas seven studies included patients with a previous history of stroke. Among the studies, 60 trials were published after 2000 and 42 studies fo- cused on participants with hypertension. The present study in- cluded 22 trials that reported the events pertaining to drug-re- lated side effects and withdrawal, in order to compare the tol- erability of the treatments. In the current study, 36 trials com- pared different BP-lowering agents against each other and nine of them were included in both the analyses. Among them, five trials compared the BP-lowering agents to placebos and four trials compared the different BP-lowering targets with different antihypertensive agents.
Regarding the quality of the studies, 88 trials were judged to be at a low risk of bias; the risk of bias was unclear in three tri- als and two trials were deemed to be at a high risk of bias. The baseline characteristics and summary of risk bias assessment of the trials are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplemen- tary Figure 1.
Meta-analysis of the association between BP-lowering treatment and various outcomes
The significance of SBP reduction pertaining to various out- comes is shown in Figure 2. BP-lowering treatment was associ- ated with a significant risk reduction in all strokes (OR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.85). Consistently, the re- duction in BP was associated with a reduction in all-cause mor- tality, cardiovascular-related death, fatal or disabling stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. The Q statistics and I2 metrics indicated that the heterogeneity pertaining to all the concerned outcomes was moderate (Supplementary Figures 2-7).

 baseline SBP below 130 mm Hg, there was no significant association between the stroke incidence and BP-lowering treatments (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.36). The present study observed a trend of increased benefits that could be gained with the increase in baseline SBP. Moreover, BP-lowering treat- ments were associated with a low risk of stroke at all target levels of SBP, except for the levels of 120 to 129 mm Hg. The present analyses showed a potential benefit pertaining to the association between BP reduction and stroke prevention in pa- tients without a previous history of stroke. However, the results were not statistically significant (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.21). Heterogeneity pertaining to the subgroups, measured using I2, is demonstrated in the subgroup plots in Supplementary Figures 8-13.
The possibility of publication bias was analyzed using Fun- nel-plot-based methods, which showed statistical significance pertaining to the outcomes of stroke and all-cause mortality (Egger’s test, P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively). The Duval and Tweedie trim and fill procedure suggested little changes in the OR and 95% CI after the adjustment (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.88) for stroke and (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.97) all-cause mortality (Supplementary Figures 14-21).
A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed and the pooled OR slightly varied from the original analysis (ranging from 0.91 to 0.92 for all-cause mortality; 0.88 to 0.89 for car- diovascular-related death; 0.79 to 0.80 for all stroke subtypes; 0.69 to 0.72 for fatal or disabling stroke; 0.83 to 0.89 for isch- emic stroke; and 0.67 to 0.81 for hemorrhagic stroke) (Supple- mentary Figures 22-27). Hence, the effect of any one study on the overall summary estimates remained low.
Comparison of different BP-lowering treatments using pairwise and network meta-analysis
A total of 82 studies were included in the BP-lowering treat- ment comparison. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed to analyze the efficacy and tolerability as outcomes. Networks of eligible comparisons for efficacy and tolerability are presented in Figure 4, showing predominantly pairwise comparisons of agents with CCB, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), or pla- cebo. Thirty pairwise treatment comparisons had direct evidence pertaining to efficacy and 11 pairwise treatment comparisons had direct evidence pertaining to tolerability.
Pairwise meta-analysis
The results of the pairwise meta-analysis for efficacy and toler- ability profiles were summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Among the monotherapies, CCB and diuretics were associated

Among the combination treatments, the combination of CCB+THZ was associated with a 30% reduction in stroke risk, compared to the placebo. An as- sessment of the comparative efficacy of different strategies re- vealed that ACEi and BB were inferior to CCB (ACEi vs. CCB [OR, 1.123; 95% CI, 1.008 to 1.252], BB vs. CCB [OR, 1.261; 95% CI, 1.116 to 1.425]), BB was inferior to ARB (OR, 1.361; 95% CI, 1.142 to 1.622), and diuretics were superior to ACEi (OR, 0.871; 95% CI, 0.771 to 0.984).

The results of the network meta-analysis are shown in Figure 5.

However, there was no correlation between the CCB+BB (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.53) or the renin inhib- itor (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.79) strategy and stroke preven- tion.

The renin in- hibitor was probably inferior to all the other treatments.

 rank associated with all the treatments is shown in Supplemen- tary Figure 29. The cluster rank plot indicated that diuretics, CCB+THZ, CCB, ARB+THZ, and ARB were associated not only with a reduction in stroke risk, but also a lower rate of with- drawal, owing to drug-related side effects (Figure 6). Sensitivity analyses stratified by age (age ≤60 or >60 years), comorbidities (history of hypertension, stroke, diabetes, or heart failure), and baseline SBP (baseline SBP ≤150 or >150 mm Hg) showed ro- bust results pertaining to the efficacy (Supplementary Table 4). Diuretics ranked first in most of the analyses. It is worth men- tioning that the combination of ARB+CCB ranked first in the participants with baseline SBP above 150 mm Hg.
Network meta-analysis-tolerability
Network meta-analysis also confirmed that ACEi (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.30 to 3.52) was likely to be associated with a signifi- cantly higher risk of withdrawal, owing to drug-related side ef- fects compared to placebo. The comparative tolerability of dif- ferent strategies is shown in Figure 5.
The SUCRA values for the 11 antihypertensive agents were 23.0, 24.3, 31.3, 40.4, 46.3, 53.6, 60.6, 61.9, 67.8, 68.4, and 72.5, for ACEi+THZ, ACEi, ACEi+CCB, diuretic, renin inhibitor, CCB, CCB+THZ, BB, ARB, ARB+THZ, and placebo, respectively (Supplementary Figure 30). The mean ranks pertaining to all the treatments is shown in Supplementary Figure 31. Visual inspection of funnel plots for efficacy did not show any distinct asymmetry (Supplementary Figure 32). However, several trials fell outside the significance boundaries in the tolerability analy- sis (Supplementary Figure 33), which could be attributed to the limited number of trials.
The assessment of transitivity is shown in Supplementary Fig- ure 34. No inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates in node splitting was apparent, except for the two comparisons (placebo-ARB, CCB-ARB) on efficacy (Supplementary Table 5) and two nodes (placebo-ACEi, CCB-ACEi) on tolerability (Supplementary Table 6). Finally, the design-by-treatment in- consistency model was applied, and inconsistency for efficacy or tolerability was not detected in the current analyses (Supple- mentary Table 7).
Discussion
Using the data pertaining to 504,613 participants in 93 large RCTs, the current study has supplemented the information re- garding the selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive agents for different populations with regard to the efficacy and tolerability, and confirmed that the reduction in BP was signifi- cantly associated with lower mortality rates and stroke inci-
dence. The therapeutic benefits existed regardless of the strati- fication by comorbidities, age, and baseline SBP. All the achieved SBP levels were associated with a 15% to 45% stroke risk reduction. An interesting, but unexpected finding in the current study was that diuretics were more effective in stroke prevention, compared to the other BP-lowering treatments. CCB+THZs, CCB, ARB+THZs, and ARB were also appropriate op- tions in terms of efficacy and tolerability.
The observations in the present study are concurrent with the previously published meta-analyses with reference to the target SBP.3,21 Moreover, the present study supplemented the information that BP-lowering was significantly associated with the reduced stroke incidence in all subtypes including ischemic, hemorrhagic, and fatal or disabling stroke. The current study showed that lowering BP to a target of below 130 mm Hg could reduce the risk associated with stroke. However, this should be interpreted with caution. Among the ischemic stroke patients without intracranial artery stenosis (lacunar infarction), inten- sive lowering of BP to a target of below 130 mm Hg is more beneficial in the reduction of intracerebral hemorrhage, rather than risk of ischemic stroke.22 Moreover, intensive BP-lower- ing in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis may increase the ischemic lesion volume in the subacute stage.23 Hence, intensive BP control to a target of below 130 mm Hg should mainly be recommended for the primary prevention of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The results of the pres- ent study, confirmed that a changed in target SBP from 140 to 130 mm Hg was necessary.2,3 The target SBP for antihyperten- sive treatment is controversial, especially for the populations in different age groups. The guidelines of the Eighth Joint Na- tional Committee (JNC8) (2014) recommend a goal of BP below 140/90 mm Hg in patients younger than 60 years and a more relaxed goal of below 150/90 mm Hg in those older than 60 years.24 Another meta-analysis explored the benefits and harms of intensive BP management in adults aged 60 years or above and found that the treatment with a target BP below 150 mm Hg improves the health outcomes including stroke in older adults and lower targets (≤140/85 mm Hg) are associated with a marginally significant decrease in stroke incidence.25
In the present study, the network meta-analysis suggested that diuretics, CCB, ARB, ACEi, and all diuretic-based combi- nation therapies were effective in stroke prevention. This was consistent with the 2017 high BP guideline, which observed that no class of antihypertensive medications were better than THZs in reducing the risk of stroke and various cardiovascular outcomes.5 However, the present study differs from the 2017 high BP guideline in some aspects. For instance, the 2017 high BP guideline excluded placebo-controlled trials, whereas the

 Vol. 23 / No. 1 / January 2021
current study included the trials that compared BP-lowering agents to placebo controls. Moreover, the 2017 high BP guide- line examined only the first-line antihypertensive medications including diuretics, ACEis, ARBs, CCBs, and BBs, whereas the current study examined all the available antihypertensive medi- cations.
Diuretics have been preferred as the first-line antihyperten- sive agents since the release of the results of the Antihyper- tensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), which suggested that diuretics were as effective as CCBs in reducing specified endpoints.26 However, a previous meta-analysis explored the efficacy of CCBs and other antihy- pertensive agents and reported that there was no significant difference between CCBs and other comparators with regard to the efficacy.6 the present analysis included the trials published in or after 2000 and suggested that CCB+THZs is the most ef- fective therapy for the reduction of stroke incidence, followed by ARB+CCB, diuretics, and ARB+diuretics. In view of these findings, CCB, ARB, and diuretics could be employed as the first- line drugs for stroke prevention. However, in view of the adverse effects of diuretics, especially at high dosages, caution should be exercised when prescribing to populations with an increased risk of developing diabetes and gout. In the aforementioned pa- tients, monotherapy using CCBs and ARBs or combinations with diuretic therapies might be appropriate alternatives.
Thus far, no network meta-analysis has been performed to examine the efficacy and tolerability of various antihypertensive agents for stroke prevention in the entire population. A previous network meta-analysis studied the various antihypertensive agents for stroke prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes and concluded that none of the antihypertensive agents were superior to one another, including the placebos.27 The current study demonstrated that ACEi-based single or combination therapies were most likely to be associated with the withdrawal, owing to drug-related side effects, whereas ARB-based single or combination therapies were well tolerated. This advantage might be helpful in the decision-making process when balanc- ing the efficacy and feasibility.
The current study has certain limitations. First, a relatively small number of trials exploring the effects of antihypertensive agents for secondary stroke prevention were included, which precluded the execution of a formal network meta-analysis to determine the relative efficacy of different antihypertensive therapies for secondary stroke prevention. Second, the transi- tivity assumption during the network analysis was unavoidable. Many RCTs included in the present analysis involved combina- tion therapies and the inclusion of combination therapies in network meta-analysis of first-line treatments would introduce
intransitivity.28 Third, the concurrent discretionary use of statins, dual anti-platelets therapy, stringent glycemic control by new diabetes drugs, lifestyle coaching, and the ‘add-on’ antihyper- tensive drugs allowed in the recent/newer trials might diminish the marginal benefit of the new classes of antihypertensive drugs. Fourth, the present study failed to acquire the relevant data from studies involving diabetic subgroups, stroke subtypes, reason for withdrawal, the elapsed time between initiation of antihypertensive agents and the index stroke, as most of these studies were not included. Fifth, as the present review includes the studies that were published over a long period of time (1966–2018), the definition of stroke and the incorporation of the advances in neuroimaging can be considered to be different among the trials. Sixth, considering the ageing population, an average duration of follow-up of 3.3 years remains limited and trials with longer follow-up periods are warranted. Lastly, the trials included in the current study varied in several aspects, including the study population, race, baseline characteristics, study methodology, and concurrent use of multiple classes of antihypertensive drug. Consequently, the possibility that the differences between treatment strategies attributed to the aforementioned biases could not be excluded. The present study attempted to minimize the heterogeneity by performing sen- sitivity and subgroup analyses, in order to provide more robust conclusions.
In conclusion, the BP-lowering strategy is significantly asso- ciated with the risk reduction of all-cause mortality, cardiovas- cular-related death, all stroke types (fatal or nonfatal), disabling stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. Monotherapy with diuretics, CCB or ARB, and their combinations could be employed as the first-line treatments for stroke prevention in terms of the efficacy and tolerability. Relatively, ACEi has a higher risk of side effect-related withdrawal.

Supplementary methods. Details about statistical analysis
To clarify the effects of blood pressure lowering agents on the relative risk of stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, fatal or disabling stroke, cardiovascular death, and all cause death, we combined trials of blood pressure lowering agents versus placebo and higher versus lower blood pressure lowering targets and performed traditional meta–analysis. Two trials which com- pared angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)+angiotensin-con- verting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) with ACEi were also included for the first objective.1,2 For another two trials with two active groups and a placebo group,3,4 we combined the events of the active groups for blood pressure lowering analysis. For one trial with three different blood pressure lowering targets,5 we com- bined the two lower targets for analysis. We calculated relative risks from the number of events and participants for each out- come in each trial and pooled results with Mantel-Haenszel and Hartung-Knapp adjustment for random effects models. Random model other than fixed model was chosen because the included trials differed to some extent, both clinically and methodologi- cally, and random model is generally more conservative com- pared with fixed effects model if heterogeneity is present. We assessed the magnitude of statistical heterogeneity among studies using standard cochrane chi-square test, the I2 statistic (I2values of at least 50% were considered to represent substan- tial heterogeneity, while values of at least 75% indicated con- siderable heterogeneity).6 We explored evidence for heterogene- ity in estimates of treatment effect attributable to the baseline characteristics of trials by comparing summary results obtained from subsets of studies grouped by age, history of cardiovascu- lar disease, history of stroke, history of diabetes, baseline, and achieved blood pressure level. Publication bias was evaluated both graphically using a funnel plot and with the Egger statisti- cal test for funnel plot asymmetry,7 if at least 10 studies were available for each outcome. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed by repeating the meta-analysis, each time with one of the included studies omitted, to see whether any one study had disproportionately large impact on the pooled relative risk. Data used in this meta-analysis were intention to treat be- cause most of the included trials did not report as treated re- sults.
To clarify the efficacy and tolerability of different blood pressure lowering drugs for prevention of stroke, we combined the three groups of trials and did pair-wise and network meta- analysis. Ten trials of different blood pressure lowering targets which undefined any specific drugs were excluded from analysis. The outcome measure for efficacy and tolerability are
stroke and drug-related side effects withdraw, respectively. First, we did pair-wise meta-analysis with a random effects model to analyze direct treatment comparisons. We calculated the summary effect sizes as odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed heterogeneity among studies with the I2 statistic. We did not do funnel plots to test publication bias because most of the comparisons had less than 10 trials. Second, we analyzed pooled data for all blood pressure lowering treatments with random effects models, within a Bayesian framework in OpenBUGS.8 See Appendix 2 for details about the OpenBUGS codes used. Models were computed with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, using three chains with over- dispersed initial values, with Gibbs sampling based on 100,000 iterations after a burn-in phase of 50,000 iterations. Non- informative or vague priors for the overall mean effect (θ to N (0, 1002)) and the between-study standard deviation (τ to uniform (0, 2)) were given.9-11 The mean of the posterior distribution was reported as the point estimate odds ratio, and the corresponding 95% credible intervals were obtained with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the posterior distribution, after adjustment for multiple arm trials. We tested the adequacy of burn-in and convergence (reaching a stable equilibrium distribution) using visual inspection of parameter fluctuation depicted in trace plots and estimating the values of the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic.12 Model fit was evaluated with the total residual deviance, which indicated good fit, if it approximated the number of data points.
Inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence can suggest that the transitivity assumption might not hold. We assessed evidence for consistency in the networks in two ways. First, we used node-split approach to contrast direct evidence with indirect evidence from the entire network on each node.11,13,14 A Bayesian P-value was calculated to estimate difference between direct and indirect evidence by counting the proportion of times the direct treatment effect exceeded the indirect treatment effect.14 Second, we used the design-by- treatment interaction model that provides a single inference, using the chi-square test, about the plausibility of assuming consistency throughout the entire network.15
The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and rankograms was used to provide a hierarchy of the regimens.16 We also used two-dimensional plots and clustering methods to obtain meaningful groups of the treatments.17 We assessed small study effects with comparison adjusted funnel plot symmetry.17
To investigate the generalisability of the findings, we assessed the effects of differing trial and participant characteristics on the outcomes in sensitivity analyses by restricting analyses to

 studies with the following design characteristics: hypertensive participants; excluding heart failure participants; published in 2000 or later; duration of follow-up longer than 3 years. We did subgroup analyses according to age (age ≤60 and >60 years), history of stroke (no defines as participants with a history of stroke account for less than 5% of overall participants in a trial, yes defines as all of the participants has a history of stroke in a trial), history of diabetes mellitus (DM; no defines as participants with a history of DM account for less than
5% of overall participants in a trial, yes defines as all of the participants has a history of DM in a trial), and baseline systolic blood pressure (≤150 or >150 mm Hg).
For traditional meta-analyses we used R version 3.4.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). For network meta-analyses we used OpenBUGS 3.2.3 and STATA 14.0 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA).




Role of Blood Lipid Levels and Lipid-Lowering Therapy in Stroke Patients with Different Levels of Cerebral Artery Diseases: Reconsidering Recent Stroke Guidelines
Jong S. Kim

Hyperlipidemia is an important risk factor for ischemic stroke; the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Level and Treat Stroke to Target studies have shown that statins are beneficial for patients with stroke and that a low target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration may maximize this benefit. Based on these results, recent guidelines have emphasized the application of “high-intensity statins” and “low LDL-C target” strategies in patients with stroke. However, it should be kept in mind that the role of blood lipids as a risk factor and benefit of lipid-lowering therapy are different among patients with different levels of cerebral arterial diseases. Studies have suggested that hypolipidemia, but not hyperlipidemia, is a risk factor for small vessel diseases (SVDs) such as intracerebral hemorrhages, microbleeds, white matter hyperintensities, and perhaps, lacunar infarction. Although lipid-lowering agents might benefit certain patients with SVD, high-intensity statin and low LDL-C target strategies cannot be applied. In contrast, these strategies are important in patients with extracranial atherosclerosis, such as internal carotid disease, considering ample evidence of the benefits of lipid-lowering agents. Imaging studies have shown that statins stabilize vulnerable plaques in these patients. Although lipid-lowering agents are likely to benefit patients with intracranial atherosclerosis, the degree of their benefit and appropriate target LDL-C level for these patients remain unclear. More studies are needed to elucidate the appropriate lipid-modifying strategies in patients with stroke with different levels of cerebral artery disease.

Introduction
Hyperlipidemia is an important risk factor for coronary and cere- bral artery atherosclerosis. However, its impact may differ accord- ing to stroke subtype. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort study,1 clinical ischemic stroke was documented in 305 of 14,175 participants over a mean 10-year follow-up period. Multi-
variable analysis revealed a weak and inconsistent association be- tween low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration and ischemic stroke, which differs from the close association of LDL-C with coronary heart disease. This difference may be at- tributed to differences in the relationships of LDL-C with various stroke subtypes, for example, large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) versus lacunar infarction (LI). Thus, although randomized con-

 trolled trials have shown that reducing circulating LDL-C levels by using statins is associated with a lower recurrent cardiovascular event risk in patients with coronary heart disease,2 the benefits of statin use in patients with stroke should be interpreted with cau- tion.
Indeed, trials suggest that statin use is beneficial in patients with stroke as well. In the Heart Protection Study (HPS),3 inves- tigators recruited 3,280 adults (aged 40 to 80 years) with stroke and an additional 17,256 with other occlusive arterial diseases or diabetes. The subjects were randomly allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily or a matching placebo. Overall, there was a significant 25% reduction in the first event rate for stroke (444 [43%] simvastatin vs. 585 [57%] placebo; P<0.0001) and no apparent difference in hemorrhagic stroke (51 [0.5%] vs. 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 1.40; P=0.8). The Stroke Pre- vention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Level (SPARCL) tri- al4 evaluated the efficacy of statin therapy in patients with stroke who did not have a history of coronary heart disease. In total, 4,732 patients who had experienced stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were randomized to receive either atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo. Atorvastatin use was associated with a 16% reduction in the cardiovascular event risk. In particular, post hoc analysis revealed that, compared with patients who had an increase or no change in LDL-C, patients with a ≥50% reduction in LDL-C level had a 31% reduction in stroke risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87; P=0.0016).5
In the binational (French and Korean) Treat Stroke to Target (TST) study,6 the investigators enrolled patients who had experi- enced a stroke or TIA and showed evidence of cerebrovascular or cardiac atherosclerosis. They were randomly assigned to the lower target (LDL-C level <70 mg/dL) or higher target group (LDL-C level, 100±10 mg/dL). The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new ischemic symptoms requiring urgent coronary or carotid/cerebral revascularization, and vascular death. In total, 2,860 patients were enrolled and followed-up for a median of 3.5 years. The mean LDL-C concen- trations achieved were 65 and 96 mg/dL in the lower target and higher target groups, respectively. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 121 (8.5%) and 156 (10.9%) participants, respectively (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.98; P=0.035). Similar results were obtained when French participants were analyzed separate- ly;7 the primary endpoint occurred in 9.6% and 12.9% of the par- ticipants, respectively (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.94; P=0.019). Myocardial infarction or urgent coronary revascularization occurred in 1.7% and 2.5% of the participants, respectively (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.20; P=0.18), and cerebral infarction or ur- gent cerebral revascularization occurred in 6.7% and 9.1% of the patients, respectively (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99; P=0.046).
Based on these results, recent guidelines have recommended the use of a high-dose statin with a low LDL-C target in pa- tients with ischemic stroke.8-10 However, there are concerns that this strategy may not be universally applied to all patients with ischemic stroke. In the HPS trial,3 among participants with prior stroke, there was no apparent reduction in the incidence of recur- rent stroke (rate ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.22) in the simvas- tatin group, even if there was a significant reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs. 488 [29.8%], P=0001). Although this result may have been attributed to the relatively small incidence of recurrent strokes in patients with prior stroke, this may suggest that the impact of statins on the recurrence of a stroke may not be as great as in the prevention of coronary dis- ease. In the SPARCL trial, further analysis showed that there was a 33% reduction in participants who had internal carotid artery (ICA) disease, whereas statin administration had a minor effect in participants who did not have ICA disease,11 who were likely to have vascular diseases in the more distal cerebral artery, such as intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) or small vessel disease (SVD).
Finally, in the TST trial, although the lower target strategy was superior to the higher target strategy in the French population, the benefit of the “lower target” was not evident when South Ko- rean patients were separately analyzed. Three hundred and seven and 355 patients were assigned to the lower target and higher target groups, respectively. After a median 2.0-year follow-up, the average LDL-C levels achieved were 66 and 96 mg/dL in the lower target and higher target groups, respectively. Preliminary analysis showed neutral results for the primary endpoint. Although the “lower target” strategy was clearly more favorable in the preven- tion of coronary diseases, it apparently was less effective than the “higher target” strategy in the prevention of stroke and TIA (un- published data).
Considering that extracranial atherosclerosis (ECAS) is less common in Asian than in French subjects, this difference may be attributed to the lower incidence of ICA disease and a higher incidence of ICAS or SVD among South Koreans than their French counterparts. However, the results should be cautiously interpret- ed given the relatively small outcomes and shorter follow-up pe- riod in the South Korean than in the French counterparts (median 2.0 years vs. 5.3 years, respectively). Therefore, the South Korean extension study is currently ongoing with an estimated average follow-up duration of 5.0 years.
The purpose of this narrative review was to describe the role of blood lipids as a risk factor for various subtypes of non-cardi- oembolic stroke. The differences in the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy on various stroke subtypes are also described. Because most lipid-lowering agents studied to date are statins, this review will primarily focus on statin therapies.

Small vessel disease
SVD manifests as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), LI, ce- rebral microbleeds (CMBs), or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
Hemorrhagic small vessel disease (intracerebral hemorrhage)
Role of blood lipid in hemorrhagic small vessel disease
Although hyperlipidemia is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke, it may protect individuals from developing ICH. A study in the United States of America (USA) examined the relationship between the serum total cho- lesterol level and risk of death from a stroke during a 6-year follow-up in 350,977 men aged 35 to 57 years. They found that the 6-year risk of death from ICH was three times higher in men with serum total cholesterol levels <160 mg/dL.12 A South Kore- an study also showed that hypocholesterolemia was associated with an increased ICH risk. This study additionally revealed that the ICH risk in subjects with hypocholesterolemia was more augmented in those with concomitant hypertension.13 Another South Korean case-control study showed that decreased fat in- take was an important factor for ICH development in men.14 A recent meta-analysis15 involving 12 prospective studies with 476,173 participants showed that a 10 mg/dL increase in LDL-C was associated with a 3% lower ICH risk (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98). The association appeared to be more pronounced in Asians (pooled RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.98) relative to Caucasians (pooled RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.00). Decreased serum lipid levels were also found to be an in- dependent risk factor for CMBs.16 Thus, hypolipidemia appears to be a risk factor for brain microbleeds or macrobleeds, partic- ularly in patients with hypertension. Differences in serum cho- lesterol levels among patients with different types of stroke were also demonstrated in an autopsy study from Japan,17 with mean serum cholesterol levels of 164±2, 177±3, and 200±4 mg/dL for patients with ICH, SVD, and cortical infarction, re- spectively. These data appear to be related to the degree of un- derlying vascular atherosclerosis among the groups; the mean values of atherosclerosis scores (assigning grade 0 for no steno- sis to 4 for ≥50% stenosis in each of the 22 sites of the basal cerebral arteries) were 25±1, 35±2, and 40±2, respectively.
Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage
Since the SPARCL study showed that patients on statin treatment had a significant increase (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.55) in the ICH risk,4 there had been concerns regarding ICH development in
patients taking statins. In 2011, a meta-analysis involving 23 ran- domized trials and 19 observational studies was published,18 which showed that statin use was not associated with an increased ICH risk in randomized trials (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.41), cohort studies (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.10), or case-control studies (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.88). Another meta-analysis published a year later included 91,588 and 91,215 subjects in the statin treatment and control groups, respectively.19 Although total stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.91; P<0.0001) and all- cause mortality (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.96; P=0.0007) were significantly reduced in the statin therapy group, there was no sig- nificant difference in the ICH incidence between the groups (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.32; P=0.47). ICH risk was not related to the degree of LDL-C reduction or achieved LDL-C level.
Subsequently, a large population-based Swedish study was pub- lished that included 7,696 ICH cases and 14,670 age-sex-matched stroke-free controls.20 After adjusting for vascular risk factors and the use of antithrombotic therapy, statin use before ICH was as- sociated with a decreased ICH risk in patients (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.74). This protective mechanism was thought to be due to the pleiotropic effects of statins, such as anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties that may protect the cerebral vessels.21 A more recent meta-analysis showed that patients who used statins before ICH had a decreased mortality risk at 3 months after symptom onset (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.68) and an increased probability of good functional outcomes (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.19), as compared with those who did not.22 Therefore, although hypocholesterolemia appears to be a risk factor for ICH, partic- ularly in those with hypertension, statin use does not appear to increase the ICH risk in the normal population and may ameliorate the severity of ICH if it develops.
A recent meta-analysis examined the relationship between statin use and the development of CMBs.23 It included seven stud- ies (n=3,734 participants, with an unselected general population [n=1,965], patients with ischemic stroke [n=849], patients with hemorrhagic stroke [n=252], and patients with hypertension aged >60 years [n=668]). The results showed that statin use was not associated with CMBs in either unadjusted (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.74) or adjusted analyses (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.86). Sta- tin use was more strongly related to lobar CMB presence (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.72) in the unadjusted, but not in the adjusted analysis (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.86 to 5.91). Thus, statin treatment did not appear to cause CMBs overall.
Unfortunately, there have been no randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy or hazards of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with ICH. A retrospective study from Taiwan, which used the National Health Insurance Research Database data, compared the outcomes of early statin users (n=749) and statin non-users
https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2021.01249
http://j-stroke.org 151

 (n=7,583). During follow-up, the incidence of recurrent ICH was similar between the two groups: 9.2% and 8.9% in the statin and control groups, respectively. However, the mortality rate was significantly lower in patients in the statin group: 90 (12.0%) and 1,519 (20.0%) in the statin and control groups (adjusted HR, 0.742; 95% CI, 0.598 to 0.919), respectively.24 Another study from China that used data from the China National Stroke Registry analyzed 3,218 admitted patients with ICH; 220 (6.8%) were on statins during their hospitalization. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with ICH on statins had better functional outcomes at 3 months (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.36) and at 1 year (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.37 to 3.06), and lower mortality rates at 3 months (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.87) and 1 year (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.86) than those without statin therapy.25
A retrospective study from Japan26 involved 381 patients with ICH, among whom statins were used in 56 patients. Serum total cholesterol and LDL-C levels were significantly lower in the statin group than in the non-statin group. Hematoma volume was inversely correlated with total cholesterol and LDL-C levels in both groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that serum cholesterol levels ≤150 mg/dL were associated with worsening of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.63) and increased hematoma volume (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.13) in patients with ICH. Similar findings were observed when patients who used statins were analyzed separately. A more recent retrospective Finnish study27 analyzed 964 patients with ICH and reported that, after adjusting for factors such as age, NIHSS, Glasgow Coma Scale, ICH volume, and intraventricular hemorrhage, lower LDL-C levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.93; P=0.028).
Thus, statin use after ICH may not increase the risk of further ICH and may improve the functional outcome and mortality in patients with ICH. However, excessive lowering of cholesterol levels by statins may have to be avoided. However, these retrospective studies have limitations. Details were frequently unknown, such as why and when the statin was initiated, the type and dose of statin, and the duration of treatment. Prospective, controlled trials are needed to elucidate whether statin therapy is needed in patients with ICH, and if so, when and with what dosage should be initiated.
Ischemic small vessel disease
White matter hyperintensities
(1) Role of blood lipid and white matter hyperintensities
The results of studies on WMH should be interpreted cautious-
ly for the following reasons: First, WMH may not always be an ischemic lesion but can be due to demyelinating diseases or degenerative gliosis. Second, hyperlipidemia may play a role in the development of LAA, and resultant brain hypoperfusion may lead to WMH. Thus, its effect on the underlying large ce- rebral artery may, in turn, affect the presence of WMH. Third, WMH development may be associated with certain genetic factors, the prevalence of which may differ across ethnicities.28 These limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting the results of WMH studies.
While WMHs are known to be associated with old age and hypertension,29 the relationship between blood lipids and WMH remains unclear.30 In a case-control study from China involving 333 and 503 patients with and without WMH, respectively,31 risk factors such as age, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension, but not hyperlipidemia, were associated with the prevalence of WMH. In another study that analyzed two independent hospi- tal-based ischemic stroke cohorts (Massachusetts General Hos- pital in Boston, USA and Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, Spain), the only independent risk factor clearly related to WMH was hyperlipidemia; patients with hyperlipidemia had significant- ly (P<0.01) less severe WMH in both cohorts.32 The Austrian Stroke Prevention Study also showed that age and hyperten- sion were positively associated with the WMH degree, whereas the serum cholesterol level was negatively associated.33 Thus, similar to ICH, hypocholesterolemia appears to be associated with WMH, while hyperlipidemia may be protective.
(2) Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with white matter hy- perintensities
In the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a population-based longitudinal study, 1,919 participants underwent two magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) at approximately 5-year intervals. Overall, 538 (28%) patients showed worsening of WMH by one grade in most patients (85%). The study analyzed the risk fac- tors associated with WMH worsening separately in patients with initially low-grade (grade 0-1) WMH and those with a higher initial grade. Age, high diastolic blood pressure, and de- creased LDL-C levels were associated with worsening of WMH. Although statin use was not related to WMH changes in gen- eral, it was associated with an increased WMH progression risk in patients with initially high-grade WMH.34
In the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk study,35 investigators performed repeated brain MRIs to exam- ine the effect of pravastatin 40 mg/day on the progression of WMH volume. After a mean treatment period of 33 months, WMH volume increased by 1.1 cm3 in both the 270 place- bo-treated and 265 pravastatin-treated subjects, reflecting no

difference between the two treatment groups. The Cardiovas- cular Risk Factors and Aging and Incidence of Dementia MRI substudy36 showed that hyperlipidemia at mid-life was not associated with late-life WMH. However, statin use at mid-life appears to be associated with decreased late-life WMH. Un- fortunately, the study was underpowered because of the small number of enrolled patients (n=112).
The Regression of Cerebral Artery Stenosis study was a ran- domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that primarily evaluated the effects of statins on middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis progression among stroke-free individuals. Two hun- dred and eight subjects were randomly assigned to either the placebo (n=102) or simvastatin 20 mg daily (n=106) group. After 2 years of follow-up, there was no significant change in WMH volume between the statin and placebo groups as a whole. However, in individuals with severe baseline WMH, the median volume increase was less in the statin group (1.9 cm3) than in the placebo group (3.0 cm3; P=0.047). Their results were at odds with the CHS study results described above.
Thus, it appears that mid-life hypocholesterolemia is asso- ciated with late-life WMH. However, the relationship between statin use and late-life WMH remains unclear. As statin use is closely related to hyperlipidemia, the association between serum cholesterol and WMH may be confounded by statin use. Additionally, statins may have two faces: they may increase late-life WMH by decreasing serum cholesterol but may pre- vent WMH via other pleiotropic effects. Finally, as addressed above, statins may improve cerebral perfusion by preventing underlying LAA, which may, in turn, prevent late-life WMH.
Lacunar infarcts
(1) Heterogeneity of so-called lacunar infarction
Before we discuss the role of blood lipid or lipid-lowering thera-
py in patients with an LI, we need to consider the heteroge- neous nature of LIs that has not been appropriately considered in previous studies on lipids.
LI, a small, deep infarction, is caused by deep perforating arterial disease and is pathologically characterized by lipohya- linosis or fibrinoid degeneration rather than by significant lipid deposits in the vessel wall. However, recent studies have shown that the pathology of “LI,” defined using imaging criteria, may be heterogeneous. Local thrombi or atheromas in patients with ICAS may obliterate the orifice of the perforator and produce LI associated with clinical “lacunar syndromes”; this is called branch atheromatous disease (BAD).37 Imaging methods such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomo- graphic angiography (CTA) can identify such cases. High-reso- lution vessel wall MRI (HR-MRI) may be needed to identify mild and diffuse atherosclerosis in intracranial arteries that may not be detected by conventional MRA or CTA.38 Because the so- called BAD or “branch occlusion” is essentially an LAA, this con- dition is likely to be associated with atherosclerosis rather than with classical SVD pathologies.
Consequently, Nah et al.39 investigated whether indicators of SVD and atherosclerosis in patients with LI (subcortical or brain- stem infarct of diameter ≤20 mm) differed according to the le- sion location and presence of parent artery atherosclerotic dis- ease (PAD). They assessed 449 patients with LI within 48 hours of stroke onset. The LIs were characterized as proximal LIs (pLIs) if the lesions abutted the main artery and distal LIs (dLIs) if they did not. The LIs were also classified according to the lesion location and presence of PAD: (1) pLI with PAD (pLI+PAD); (2) pLI without PAD (pLI–PAD); and (3) dLI without PAD (dLI–PAD) (Figure 1). The prevalence of SVD indicators (WMH and CMB) and atherosclerosis (cerebral atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease) were compared among the groups. The pLI+PAD group had the highest prevalence of atherosclerosis indicators

 and lowest prevalence of SVD indicators, whereas the dLI–PAD group had the lowest prevalence of atherosclerosis indicators and highest prevalence of SVD indicators. The pLI–PAD group showed intermediate features. These results suggest that LI pathogenesis is heterogeneous and varies according to the le- sion location and presence of PAD. Additionally, compared with pLI, dLI was marginally associated with hypertension (P=0.08) but was less frequently associated with diabetes (P=0.003). In their study, the prevalence of hyperlipidemia did not differ among the groups. However, in a similar study conducted in another part of Asia,40 LDL-C was more closely associated with pLI than with dLI in older patients (aged >65 years). In anoth- er South Korean study, the authors found that, when stroke recurred, patients with pLI were more likely to develop athero- sclerotic cerebral infarction than those with dLI,41 again sug- gesting that pLI may have more atherosclerotic characteristics than dLI.
(2) Role of blood lipid and lacunar infarctions
In a cross-sectional study conducted in China,42 the investiga- tors analyzed the clinical characteristics of 1,982 patients with ischemic stroke. The stroke subtypes were classified as LAA, LI, cardioembolism, or undetermined, and 1,207, 566, 173, and 36 of the participants were diagnosed with each of these sub- types, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that hyper- tension (OR, 1.832) and WMH (OR, 1.865) were more strongly associated with LI than LAA, whereas LDL-C levels (OR, 0.774) were more strongly associated with LAA than with LI. In an- other study,43 the investigators compared the risk factors in 573 participants with a single LI with those of 122 participants with recurrent LIs. They found that hypertension was more prevalent (81% vs. 70%, respectively; P=0.01), whereas hyper- lipidemia was less prevalent (15% vs. 24%; P=0.025) in the re- current-LI group than in the single-LI group. The authors sug- gested that hypertension may be a risk factor for LI recurrence, whereas hyperlipidemia might reduce this risk.
(3) Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with lacunar infarction Several Asian studies have investigated the possibility that the effect of lipid-lowering therapy may differ according to the stroke subtype. In the randomized Japan Statin Treatment Against Recurrent Stroke (JSTAR)44 study, patients aged 45 to 80 years with a history of non-cardiogenic ischemic stroke within the preceding 1 month to 3 years were enrolled at 123 centers. A total of 1,578 patients were randomly allocated to the pravastatin (10 mg/day) or control group. Pravastatin treat- ment reduced stroke recurrence in patients with LAA (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.74; P=0.0047), but not in those with other
stroke subtypes. In patients with LI, there was a tendency for increased stroke occurrence in the statin group, although this was not statistically significant.
On the other hand, a retrospective study from Spain45 assessed 2,742 patients with stroke, among whom 281 patients (10.2%) were pre-stroke statin users. Logistic regression analyses showed that statin treatment was an independent predictor for better functional outcome at discharge among all patients with stroke (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.39 to 3.1), those with LAA (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.33 to 5.84), and those with LI (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.15 to 4.52). The authors hypothesized that statins might improve cerebral endothelial function in these patients.
Thus, hyperlipidemia does not play an important role in the development of LI compared with LAA, and the effect of lip- id-lowering therapy on LI remains unclear. As discussed above, it should be remembered that LI is a heterogeneous condition; among patients with LI, pLI may be more closely associated with hyperlipidemia and may respond better to statin therapy than dLI. Further studies are needed to determine whether lipid-lowering therapy is effective, at least in patients with a certain subtype of LI.
Intracranial atherosclerosis
Role of blood lipid in intracranial atherosclerosis
Similar to atherosclerosis in other vessels, ICAS is caused by vascular risk factors, such as age, hypertension, diabetes melli- tus, cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia. However, studies that compared the risk factors between ICAS and ECAS have shown that hyperlipidemia is a less important risk factor for ICAS than for ECAS.46-51 To the best of my knowledge, no stud- ies have reported the opposite results. Because Asians have lower serum cholesterol levels than Caucasians, this difference may at least in part explain the ethnic differences in the loca- tion of cerebral atherosclerosis. Intracranial arteries may have an inherent resistance to the toxic effects of hypercholesterol- emia. In monkeys52 and rabbits,53 the development of athero- sclerosis after consuming an atherogenic diet occurred signifi- cantly later in intracranial arteries than in extracranial arteries. It has been suggested that a specific glycocalyx composition on luminal endothelial cells might inhibit trapping of chylomi- crons and very-low-density lipoprotein, resulting in reduced deposition of apolipoproteins in the intima of intracranial ves- sels.52
Although there may be differences in the pathological fea- tures between ICAS and ECAS, few studies have explored this issue. A recent autopsy study from Hong Kong54 examined the

pathology of large intracranial arteries in 32 autopsy cases aged ≥45 years. Although atherosclerotic lesions were pres- ent in 91 (71%) of the 128 arteries, features of complicated plaques were infrequent; plaque hemorrhage was encountered in 12%, neo-vasculature in 12%, lumen thrombi in 13%, macrophage infiltration in 20%, and calcification in 25% of arteries. Luminal narrowing was the most severe in the MCA, followed by the vertebral artery (VA), while the basilar artery (BA) was the least stenotic. Thus, it appears that the lesions generally lacked features of complicated plaques in proximal ICA atherosclerotic disease. However, it should be kept in mind that the complicated plaques described in proximal ICA disease were obtained primarily in patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy, a highly selected patient population mostly with severe atherosclerosis, whereas most of the subjects in the autopsy study described above did not have a history of stroke.
Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with intracranial ath- erosclerosis
There have been few studies on lipid-lowering therapies that exclusively focus on ICAS. In a recent study,55 the investigators enrolled statin-naïve patients with ischemic stroke who had symptomatic ICAS (>50% stenosis) in the proximal portion of the MCA, BA, or intracranial portion of the ICA. Atorvastatin (40 to 80 mg) or rosuvastatin (20 mg) was administered for 6 months, and patients underwent HR-MRI before and after sta- tin treatment. Pre-specified endpoints that were measured af- ter 6 months of statin treatment were: (1) degree of stenosis, (2) remodeling index, (3) wall area index, and (4) enhancement volume of atherosclerotic plaque on HR-MRI. The LDL-C con- centrations of the 77 enrolled patients at the initial and fol- low-up assessments were 125.8±35.7 and 61.0±19.3 mg/dL, respectively. Overall, statin treatment significantly reduced plaque accumulation (32.07±39.15 mm3 vs. 17.06±34.53 mm3, P=0.013), wall area index (7.5±4.3 vs. 5.9±4.1, P=0.016), and degree of stenosis (76.5%±20.2% vs. 64.1%±21.3%, P<0.001), but not the remodeling index (P=0.195). This suggests that high-dose statins may benefit patients with symptomatic ICAS. However, this study has important limitations. First, it was un- certain whether such MRI changes could translate into clinical benefits. Second, because there was no control group, it re- mains unclear whether the MRI changes were indeed due to statin administration. Third, it is unknown whether the dose used in this study was the most appropriate for patients with ICAS. It is noteworthy that despite intensive statin therapy, 35% of the participants showed no beneficial changes; they showed unchanged or worsened vessel pathologies.
To the best of my knowledge, there is only one controlled study on statins for asymptomatic ICAS. In a single-center prospective study,56 71 asymptomatic patients with ICAS were treated with rosuvastatin, and their vascular stenoses were evaluated using transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) be- fore and after treatment. The therapeutic target was a reduction in LDL-C concentration of ≤1.8 mmol/L or a ≥50% reduction from baseline over 2 years. The participants were allocated to an intensive statin treatment (IST) or standard statin treatment (SST) group. One hundred and four ICASs were identified in 51 participants and 47 in 20 in the IST and SST groups, respectively. After 1 year, there was a larger decrease in LDL-C concentration in the IST than in the SST group (1.5±0.3 mmol/L vs. 2.2±0.6 mmol/L, respectively; P≤0.001). The percentage regression of the ICAS lesions in the IST group tended to be greater than that in the SST group (26.3% vs. 5.9%, P=0.052). Forty-nine lesions in 25 participants and 16 lesions in seven in the IST and SST groups, respectively, were reassessed 2 years later. At this time, the LDL-C concentration had decreased more in the IST group than in the SST group (1.6±0.3 mmol/L vs. 2.46±0.8 mmol/L, P=0.048), and the percentage regression of ICAS lesions in the IST group was significantly greater than that in the SST group (34.7% vs. 6.3%, P=0.017). This result suggests that the degree of stenosis in ICAS can be ameliorated using intensive statin therapy. However, this study had limitations: the number of participants who were followed for 2 years was too small, and the stenosis was assessed by TCCS rather than by standard methods, such as MRA, CTA, or conventional angiography.
Thus, although statins probably benefit patients with ICAS, further studies including a control group, assessment of clinical endpoints, and comparison of the effects of statin therapy in patients with ICAS and ECAS are required. Changes in vessel stenosis or plaque volume should also be assessed more me- ticulously. Considering the heterogeneity of ICAS, other issues should be considered in future trials. First, strokes in patients with ICAS are caused by various mechanisms, including athero- sclerotic steno-occlusion, BAD leading to perforator occlusion, artery-to-artery embolism, and hemodynamic impairment.37,57 Recent studies have shown that risk factors and vessel wall pathology may differ among different mechanisms.39,58-62 Spe- cifically, rupture-prone positive remodeling and enhancing plaques are more frequently observed in non-BAD-type ICAS than in BAD-type ICAS.62 Therefore, it may be assumed that lipid-lowering agents might be more effective in patients with non-BAD type ICAS. Second, as imaging techniques, such as MRA and catheter angiography, can examine luminal stenosis but not vascular wall pathology, non-atherosclerotic etiologies, such as Moyamoya disease, dissection, and vasculitis can be

http://j-stroke.org 155

 miscategorized as ICAS. One diagnostic tool that can be used to examine the vessel wall is HR-MRI.63 A study from South Korea64 assessed HR-MRI findings in 95 young (≤55 years) pa- tients who were diagnosed with presumable ICAS. They found that only 26 (27.4%) had HR-MRI findings consistent with atherosclerosis, whereas others showed findings consistent with other vascular pathologies. These data suggest that diag- nosis based solely on angiogram findings may not be accurate, which may explain why the effect of statins was not consistent in patients with ICAS.55
Extracranial atherosclerosis
As discussed above, hyperlipidemia is an important risk factor for ECAS, probably more so than in ICAS. Thus, the effects of lipid-lowering agents should also be robust under these condi- tions.
Proximal internal carotid artery disease
Proximal ICA atherosclerosis has many similarities to coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor. Of the 4,731 SPARCL participants, a subset of 1,007 par- ticipants had ICA disease. In this subgroup, atorvastatin thera- py was associated with a 33% reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke, which was far greater than the 16% reduction observed in all SPARCL participants.11 Thus, among patients with stroke, those with ICA disease appear to benefit most from a high dose of statin.
Statins appear to influence the composition of the carotid plaques. A recent meta-analysis of seven studies (361 pa- tients)65 included prospective studies using serial HR-MRI in patients on statin therapy to document changes in carotid plaque composition. Outcomes included changes in lip- id-rich-necrotic-core (LRNC) volume, wall volume, and lumen volume at varying time points after initiation of statin therapy. There was no significant change in carotid wall volume or lu- men volume at any time point. While there was no significant difference in LRNC before 7 to 12 months after statin initia- tion, there was a significant decrease in LRNC volume (weight- ed mean difference –9.9 mm3; 95% CI, –8.9 to –2.3) at >12 months.
Subsequently, a population-based Rotterdam Study66 en- rolled 1,740 participants with ICA disease who underwent carotid artery MRI to determine the presence of calcification, lipid core, and intra-plaque hemorrhage. Statin treatment was associated with a higher presence of calcification (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.44), which was more apparent in patients with longer statin use. Current statin treatment was also as- sociated with a lower presence of lipid core (OR, 0.66; 95% CI,
0.42 to 1.04), but only when statins were used for ≤10 months. Although there are subtle differences in the results, the two studies suggest that statin therapy favorably influences the composition of carotid atherosclerosis by shifting the compo- sition from vulnerable plaque with a lipid core to a more stable calcified plaque.
A more recent Treat Stroke to Target–Plaque Ultrasound Study study67 assessed the serial ultrasonic carotid findings for a median follow-up of 3.1 years. Patients were randomized to the lower LDL-C target (mean, 64 mg/dL; n=201) or higher LDL-C target group (mean, 106 mg/dL; n=212). Compared with the higher-target group, the lower-target group had a similar incidence of newly diagnosed carotid plaque: 46/201 (5-year rate, 26.1%) versus 45/212 (5-year rate, 29.7%). The change in common carotid arteries intima-media thickness was signifi- cantly (P=0.004) better in the lower-target group (−10.53 μm; 95% CI, –14.21 to –6.85) than in the higher target group (−2.69 μm; 95% CI, –6.55 to 1.18). Thus, in this study, statin use with an LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL did not reduce the incidence of new carotid plaques but produced greater regression of carotid atherosclerosis than an LDL-C target of 90 to 110 mg/dL.
The benefits of statins in patients who underwent carotid revascularization have also been investigated. A popula- tion-based, retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, evaluated the statin effect in individuals aged ≥66 years who underwent carotid endarterectomy or stenting during 2002- 2014.68 The study primarily assessed the effect of pre-proce- dural statin for the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 1 year. Additionally, the benefit of persistent long- term statin use was assessed 5 years after the procedure. Of the 10,723 patients identified, 7,893 (73.6%) were pre-pro- cedural statin users. Pre-procedural statin use was associated with a 24% reduction (adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.83) in the risk of the 1-year composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. At 5 years, persistent long-term statin use was associated with a 25% risk reduction (adjusted HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.80) for the composite outcome. These results suggest that statins should be used in patients undergoing ca- rotid revascularization.
Vertebral artery disease
Unlike ICA, VA atherosclerosis has rarely been examined in clinical studies of lipid-lowering agents. Similar to ICA, VA ath- erosclerotic disease produces artery-to-artery embolism, lead- ing to posterior circulation ischemia. Therefore, the plaque-sta- bilizing effect of statins may be equally important in patients with VA disease. Thus, statins have been recommended in pa- tients with atherosclerotic VA disease.69 However, although

pathological studies are scarce owing to the fact that endar- terectomy is rarely performed in VA disease, plaque ulceration and hemorrhage are considered to be less common in VA ath- erosclerosis than in ICA disease; the lesions are more often fi- brous and smooth.70 Thus, it remains uncertain whether statins are really effective, and if so, what the optimal LDL-C target would be for patients with VA atherosclerotic disease.
Comments on recent guidelines
The 2018 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) task forces reported guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol,71 which were: (1) in patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), reduce LDL-C with high-intensity statin therapy or maximally tolerated statin therapy. The more LDL-C is reduced, the greater the subsequent risk reduction. (2) In very high-risk ASCVD, use an LDL-C threshold of 70 mg/dL and consider the addition of non-statins to statin therapy. Very high-risk ASCVD includes a history of multiple major ASCVD events, one major ASCVD event, and multiple high-risk conditions. In this paper, the au- thors appropriately used the term “atherosclerotic” disease. Thus, if ASCVD includes stroke, it should mean an “atheroscle- rotic” stroke. In that regard, this is a reasonable guideline, al- though the author still doubts whether the same principle can be applied to ICAS.
However, in subsequent guidelines, the term “atherosclerotic” was often omitted. One example was a guideline for the man- agement of patients with “acute ischemic stroke (AIS)” pub- lished in 2019.8 Authors wrote that patients with AIS should be managed according to the 2018 ACC/AHA lipid management guidelines, as described above. The second example is a guide- line by the Hellenic Stroke Organization and Hellenic Ath- erosclerosis Society.9 Authors reported that (1) patients with
ischemic stroke or TIA should receive lipid-modifying treatment with a high-intensity statin (grade of recommendation/level of evidence, 1A) and (2) patients with ischemic stroke or TIA should be treated with an LDL-C target <55 mg/dL and at least 50% reduction of baseline LDL-C levels (1B). Finally, the Euro- pean Stroke Organization (ESO)-Karolinska guideline10 reported that “Statins should be used as a part of secondary prophylac- tic treatment after an ischemic stroke or TIA.” Most benefits were observed with atorvastatin 80mg (Grade A). Aggressive intensive lipid-lowering therapy with statins (sometimes with additional ezetimibe) reduces the risk of stroke in stroke survi- vors in an LDL-C-dependent manner (Grade A).
These recommendations were based on the TST, JSTAR, and SPARCL trials3,4,6,44 that we have already discussed. In these guidelines, “ischemic stroke” should be replaced with “athero- sclerotic ischemic stroke” for the following reasons. First, TST did not include general stroke patients, but only those with evidence of cerebral/cardiac vessel atherosclerosis. Second, in the JSTAR trial, pravastatin therapy reduced stroke risk in pa- tients with LAA but not in those with LI. Third, in the SPARCL trial, the benefit of statins was minimal in patients without ICA disease, and (4) the term “ischemic stroke” broadly includes non-atherosclerotic diseases such as cardioembolic stroke, dis- section, vasculitis, Moyamoya disease, and stroke of unknown etiology. Although the ESO-Karolinska guideline10 cautiously wrote that statin use in the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke caused by less frequent non-atherosclerotic etiologies such as arterial dissection and patent foramen ovale requires further investigation, this is not enough. Although a registry study72 and a hospital study73 suggested that statin therapy may reduce recurrent stroke or vascular death risk in patients with atrial fibrillation, another study74 failed to show such a benefit. More importantly, these non-atherosclerotic strokes were excluded from the above trials, and there are no random-

 ized trials that properly examined the benefit of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with stroke associated with atrial fibrilla- tion or other determined or unknown etiologies. Thus, in the guidelines, “high dose statin” and “low LDL-C target” strategies should be limited to patients with atherosclerotic stroke, es- pecially those with ICA disease, such that physicians are not misled.
Conclusions
The roles of blood lipids and lipid-lowering therapies differ among stroke subtypes (Table 1). For SVDs, hypolipidemia ap- pears to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, microbleeds, WMH, and probably LI, especially in subjects with hyperten- sion. However, statins do not appear to increase the risk of fur- ther stroke in patients with SVD, probably because statins have various pleiotropic effects in addition to the lipid-lowering ef- fect. Although the evidence is not robust, statins may improve functional outcomes or decrease mortality in patients with ICH. Because of the paucity of clinical trials and heterogeneity of pathogenesis, study results on LI are inconclusive, although it appears clear that lipid-lowering therapy is less effective in this condition than in LAA. Although hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for ICAS, its impact is less marked than that of ECAS. Statin use is probably useful in this condition, but the effect may be less robust or inconsistent than in ECAS. Hyperlipid- emia is a definitive risk factor for ECAS, and “high dose statin” and “low LDL-C targets” should be a reasonable strategy in this condition. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether lip- id-lowering therapy is needed, and if so, what would be the appropriate LDL-C target levels in patients with stroke due to different levels of cerebral artery diseases.
